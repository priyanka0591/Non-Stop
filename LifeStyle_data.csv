Can over-exercising lead to heart attacks? Key tips to keep your heart safe,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

He cautioned, ""Primary concerns with overexercising is the strain it places on the heart. During strenuous physical activity, the heart pumps more blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. This is a normal response to exercise, and it helps improve the heart's efficiency. However, when exercise is taken to the extreme, the heart can become overworked and fatigued, increasing the risk of adverse cardiac events. One common condition associated with overexercising is known as ""athlete's heart"" or ""exercise-induced cardiac remodeling."" In individuals who consistently push their bodies to the limits, the heart undergoes structural changes to accommodate the increased demand for blood flow. While these adaptations are generally benign in well-trained athletes, they can be problematic for those who over exercise without proper guidance or recovery.""

Dr Abhijit Borse pointed out the potential risks of overexercising as -

Increased Heart Rate: Over-exercising can lead to a persistent elevated heart rate, which, over time, may weaken the heart muscle and reduce its ability to pump effectively.

Agreeing to plans that we don’t want to be a part of: We have a difficult time saying no to people. Hence, we get onboard with ideas and plans that deep down we do not want to be a part of.

Avoid setting boundaries: This is one of the most harmful things that we end up doing in people-pleasing. Be it in our personal lives or our professional space, setting boundaries is extremely important.

Ignoring our own needs: We prioritise others so much that we end up pushing our own needs down the priority list. This makes us feel frustrated and resentful.

Pretending to agree with others: We try to avoid conflict or disagreement at any cost – hence, we end up pretending to agree with others.

Apologise excessively: We are constantly in fear that people will dislike us. Hence, we end up apologising for mistakes that we have not made.

Why did the Pilgrims celebrate the first Thanksgiving? Know the complete story,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

European settlers, carrying diseases that devastated indigenous populations, made it easier for colonisers to seize lands while instances of warfare, massacres and forced displacement further tainted the relations between settlers and Native Americans. Hence, the Thanksgiving feast, although a diplomatic interaction, is still controversial as some do not consider it as a tradition of warmth and harmony but rather an alliance prompted by mutual defense concerns while the holiday remains contentious due to its historical inaccuracies, cultural appropriation and painful associations for indigenous communities.

The conventional story of Thanksgiving, often taught in schools, has it that the Wampanoag, particularly Squanto who had learned English after being captured and taken to Europe, played a crucial role in helping the Pilgrims adapt to their new environment by returning to his homeland and serving as an interpreter and guide for the settlers. He taught the Pilgrims essential skills, such as planting corn, using fish as fertiliser and hunting leading to a successful harvest for the Pilgrims in the fall of 1621.

To celebrate their newfound prosperity and express gratitude for the help received from the Wampanoag, Pilgrims organised a three-day feast and this event is now commonly referred to as the first Thanksgiving where the celebration included feasting on deer, fowl and fish, as well as native fruits and vegetables since it was a communal event that brought together the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, fostering goodwill and cooperation between the two groups.

The first Thanksgiving is often seen as a symbol of the spirit of gratitude and cooperation between different cultural groups but while it wasn't an annual tradition at that time, the idea of Thanksgiving as ‘a time to give thanks for a good harvest and the blessings of the past year’ eventually evolved into the American Thanksgiving holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. It wasn’t until 1863, during the American civil war, that President Abraham Lincoln declared a national Thanksgiving Day that was to be held each November and the holiday was annually proclaimed by every President thereafter.

However, after a joint resolution of Congress in 1941, President Franklin D Roosevelt issued a proclamation in 1942, designating the fourth Thursday in November (which is not always the last Thursday) as Thanksgiving Day. Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated to say thanks and recognise the sacrifices and blessings of the past year as with more urbanisation, Thanksgiving became a day for people to get together with their friends and family to celebrate the day with a scrumptious feast.

The holiday moved away from its cultural roots to allow immigrants of every background to participate in a common tradition.

When is Black Friday in 2023?

Black Friday falls a day after the festival of Thanksgiving, the traditional US holiday where people gather to express gratitude over a delicious meal with traditional delicacies like roast turkey apart from other dishes. Unlike earlier years, the advent of online shopping has also allowed people to shop from their comforts of home on Black Friday for a hassle-free shopping experience. This year Thanksgiving is being celebrated on November 23, 2023, while Black Friday falls on November 24, 2023.

The preparation for Christmas starts a month in advance with Black Friday as people inaugurate the shopping season availing massive discounts offered by retailers, both in physical stores and online.

Origin of Black Friday

The term Black Friday originated way back in the 1960s and early 1970s in Philadelphia when the festive vibe of Thanksgiving spilled over to the weekends with people shopping for Christmas and eating out with their family and friends which resulted in chaos on the streets making it difficult for policemen and bus drivers to handle the crowd, and cases of shoplifting and parking violations also happened. No wonder, they coined the term 'Black Friday' to describe their never-ending shifts.

While Black Friday was re-branded Big Friday for some time by department stores eager to make it sound positive, the retailers preferred the term Black Friday as the day when their ledgers were 'in the black' or in profit and 'not in the red' or in loss.",LifeStyle
Delhi to restrict entry of buses on these norms from other states if GRAP Stage IV invoked,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""Entry of all buses, including All India Tourist buses/ Contract Carriage buses/ State Transport Buses or holding any other kind of permit into Delhi from other states except CNG / Electric or BSVI diesel buses will be restricted as and when GRAP IV invokes.

""The above mentioned restrictions shall stand automatically applicable, as and when GRAP - IV is invoked from the date of issuance of this order in Delhi Gazette, and if the GRAP IV is revoked the said restrictions stand terminated automatically, no separate order will be issued,"" an official gazette notification said.

Last month, the Delhi government directed that all buses entering the national capital from Haryana will have to be run on electricity, CNG or BS-VI diesel.

Buses entering from the NCR regions of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan also need to follow these norms.

The city government's transport department said all buses entering Delhi from any city or town in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh from July 1 will only be those that run on electricity, CNG and BS-VI diesel.

The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area, a statutory body responsible for formulating strategies to combat pollution in the region, had on November 18 asked Delhi and NCR states to revoke all emergency measures, under which only CNG, electric and BS VI-compliant vehicles from other states are allowed to enter Delhi, with exemptions granted to those involved in essential services.

The air quality across the city worsened on Wednesday morning and was recorded in the very poor category.

The city's Air Quality Index stood at 394 at 9.05 am on Wednesday, up from 365 on Tuesday.

The GRAP for the NCR has been classified under four different stages of adverse air quality in Delhi viz. Stage – I 'poor' (AQI 201 – 300), Stage – II 'very poor (AQI 301-400), Stage – III 'severe' (AQI 401-450) and Stage – IV 'severe ' (AQI >450), respectively.

Meghalaya plans small museum at old Assembly building for heritage tourism,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Shillong, which was the capital of undivided Assam, is nicknamed the 'Scotland of the East' and is known for its historical importance and pristine natural beauty

The three-day Mart seeks to focus on the tourism potential of the northeast, particularly Meghalaya which is the host state.

""I think a generic policy to ensure that these kinds of heritage sites are promoted from a tourist aspect, is definitely part of the overall strategy,"" he said.

""What is important is that we are bringing in different stakeholders together and really trying to discuss and connect different dots together out here. So, that is the purpose of today's programme,"" he said.

""The Legislative Assembly building site (in Shillong)... you are aware that the Assembly (building) got burnt almost about 20 years back. And therefore not much left of it. But we have not touched it, and left it as it is because we had to do some of the assembly work there,"" he said during a press interaction.

""But as soon as we shift to the new assembly site whose construction is going on... By September 2024, we expect to inaugurate it,"" he said.

Sangma said the old building, a British-era structure, was used in undivided Assam and has a lot of history, he added.

""Definitely we have a plan along with the Speaker to have a small museum or some kind of a site there where we could have some section of the area – maybe not the whole area,"" Sangma said.

Raj Bhavan building and Rabindranath Tagore’s house also have heritage value, the chief minister said, adding that there are many such sites.

Asked about the state's strategy to balance tourism-related development and environment protection, he said the state has been focussing on sustainable tourism and ecotourism.

The government is also ensuring that it creates policies that do not put enormous pressure on certain tourist sites, Sangma said.

5 tips to follow to manage endometriosis,"Endometriosis is a health condition characterised by the growth of tissue resembling the uterine lining outside the uterus, resulting in intense pelvic pain and fertility problems hence, the one with endometriosis should stick to the foolproof measures given by the expert. Endometriosis wreaks havoc on one’s overall well-being, affecting not only your body but also your emotions and mental state. 5 tips to follow to manage endometriosis (Shutterstock)

In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Madhulika Singh, Consultant Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Ankura Hospital in Pune, shared, “Each day presents a fresh set of obstacles, from agonising pelvic pain to unwelcome weight gain, the irregular menstrual cycle and troublesome bowel issues. The symptoms of this condition are such as excessive menstrual cramps, abnormal or heavy menstrual flow and pain during intercourse, painful bowel movements and/or urination, chronic pelvic pain, abdominal bloating, nausea, fatigue, and infertility. It is crucial to consult with your doctor before attempting any home remedies for endometriosis.”

If you or someone you know is grappling with this condition and searching for effective strategies to alleviate its symptoms then follow these tips suggested by Dr Madhulika Singh to manage endometriosis:

Eat fruits and vegetables to maintain overall well-being. They contain higher levels of essential nutrients and fiber that promote feelings of fullness for longer periods compared to refined carbohydrates and fatty foods. Also, have omega-3 fatty acids which not only reduce the risk of endometriosis but also improve brain function and emotional well-being. Maintaining adequate water intake is a crucial practice with numerous advantages for your health. By staying properly hydrated, you can lower the likelihood of experiencing bloating, a frequent consequence of endometriosis. Additionally, sufficient hydration can alleviate cramps and enhance your overall well-being. So, drink enough water every day. Stick to a regular exercise routine to reduce pain and improve overall health. Weight management is another crucial aspect of exercise as obesity can negatively impact hormonal health. Losing weight can alleviate pain and symptoms for many women. Furthermore, exercise directly impacts hormone production by reducing estrogen levels and stimulating the release of endorphins. Since estrogen contributes to the development of endometriosis, engaging in regular exercise may potentially slow down or halt the progression of this condition. Make getting a good night's sleep your top priority. Many women with endometriosis struggle to achieve a peaceful night's rest. Lack of sleep among women with endometriosis resulted in heightened levels of depression, bladder pain, and an overall decline in their quality of life. Get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per day. The pain extends beyond the physical realm, taking an emotional toll as well. To alleviate this burden, calm the mind through practices such as meditation and deep breathing. Meditation can effectively alleviate symptoms of chronic pain and depression in women with endometriosis.

Dr Madhulika Singh concluded, “Living with endometriosis can be a constant battle, both physically and emotionally. It often feels like a secret struggle, with the pain and symptoms hidden behind closed doors. Endometriosis not only affects physical health but also disrupts relationships, careers, and personal goals. Recognizing these emotional impacts is essential in supporting those affected by endometriosis holistically. Mental health support should accompany medical treatments. Understanding that living with endometriosis goes beyond just physical pain, it is necessary to create a supportive environment for those impacted by this condition. If you or your loved one is having endometriosis then it is essential to adhere to a well-balanced lifestyle to control symptoms of endometriosis.”",LifeStyle
How bacteria in the stomach ease constipation: Study,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""We established the causal link between a genetic variant--the abfA cluster--to the key functional difference of probiotic B. longum in multiple model organisms, including mice and humans, and provided mechanistic and ecological insights into how a single gene cluster can affect the gut motility of hosts through arabinan metabolism,"" said Qixiao Zhai of Jiangnan University, one of the paper's co-senior authors.

Impaired gastrointestinal motility has been implicated in gut microbial dysbiosis, which is characterized by a significant decrease in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, some of which are conventionally known as probiotics. Orally administrated probiotics have therefore been widely used to alleviate symptoms.

Yet the therapeutic effect of probiotics for constipation often varies substantially across strains within the same species. Due to elusive mechanisms, the rational choice of probiotics remains challenging for medical care professionals and patients. In addition, most evidence on the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut motility mainly emerged from studies using a mouse model.

""Probiotic strains were often effective in animal models yet failed in human clinical trials or were poorly validated in humans,"" said Jiachao Zhang of Hainan University, the study's second co-senior author.

""Proof-of-concept studies based on a human cohort in combination with evidence from animal studies are urgently needed for translational research.""

Zhai, Zhang, and Shi Huang of the University of Hong Kong, the paper's third co-senior author, set out to identify and systematically validate the key genetic factors of exogenous probiotics or resident gut microbiota affecting gastrointestinal motility. They isolated 185 B. longum strains from 354 Chinese subjects who ranged in age from 0 to 108 years.

From a comprehensive library of wild B. longum strains, they discovered that the effective alleviation of constipation in mice is regulated by the abfA cluster. This key genetic factor preferentially enhances the utilization of arabinan--a common constituent of plant polysaccharides, an indigestible fibre for humans, and a poorly accessible source of nutrients for normal gut microbes.

The researchers further validated the abfA cluster's functional roles using gene-knockout experiments. In mice with constipation, B. longum, but not an abfA mutant, improved gastrointestinal transit time--an effect that was dependent upon dietary arabinan.

To establish its functional roles for ameliorating constipation in humans, the researchers used a clinical trial and a human-to-mouse faecal microbiota transplantation experiment in combination with metagenomics and metabolomics.

In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with abfA-cluster-carrying B. longum, but not an abfA-deficient strain, enriched arabinan-utilization residents, increased beneficial metabolites, and improved constipation symptoms.

Across human cohorts, abfA-cluster abundance in the faecal microbiomes predicted constipation and transplantation of abfA cluster-enriched human microbiota to mice with constipation improved gut motility.

Notably, other than B. longum, the abfA gene/cluster is prevalent in gut residents, regulating symptoms in both mice and humans.

The authors say that the abfA cluster is a gut-microbiome therapeutic target for constipation in humans. More broadly, the results suggest that genetic factors governing the unique metabolic capability of probiotics should be primarily considered for screening probiotics or inferring their treatment efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.

""Collectively, this study identified and systematically characterized a key genetic factor responsible for arabinan utilization that addressed one critical challenge in the probiotic field, namely widespread yet unknown strain specificity in probiotic treatment efficacy,"" Huang said.

“Our proof-of-concept study also established generalizable principles for the rational development of colonizable, functional probiotics with persistent treatment efficacy in multiple model organisms. Moreover, the abfA cluster is so prevalent in the gut microbiota that it can be developed as a simple yet powerful biomarker for gastrointestinal diseases.”

Coffee grounds can help prevent neurological disorders: Study,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

A team led by Jyotish Kumar, a doctoral student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and overseen by Mahesh Narayan, PhD, a professor and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in the same department, discovered that caffeic-acid-based Carbon Quantum Dots (CACQDs), which can be derived from spent coffee grounds, have the potential to protect brain cells from the damage caused by several neurodegenerative diseases.

We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join

Their findings are detailed in a report published in Environmental Research.

""Caffeic-acid based Carbon Quantum Dots have the potential to be transformative in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders,"" Kumar said. ""This is because none of the current treatments resolve the diseases; they only help manage the symptoms. Our aim is to find a cure by addressing the atomic and molecular underpinnings that drive these conditions.""

Neurodegenerative diseases are primarily characterized by the loss of neurons or brain cells. They inhibit a person's ability to perform basic functions such as movement and speech, as well as more complicated tasks including bladder and bowel functions, and cognitive abilities.

The disorders, when they are in their early stages and are caused by lifestyle or environmental factors, share several traits. These include elevated levels of free radicals -- harmful molecules that are known to contribute to other diseases such as cancer, heart disease and vision loss -- in the brain, and the aggregation of fragments of amyloid-forming proteins that can lead to plaques or fibrils in the brain.

Kumar and his colleagues found that CACQDs were neuroprotective across test tube experiments, cell lines and other models of Parkinson's disease when the disorder was caused by a pesticide called paraquat. The CACQDs, the team observed, were able to remove free radicals or prevent them from causing damage and inhibited the aggregation of amyloid protein fragments without causing any significant side effects.

The team hypothesizes that in humans, in the very early stage of a condition such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, a treatment based on CACQDs can be effective in preventing full-on disease.

""It is critical to address these disorders before they reach the clinical stage,"" Narayan said. ""At that point, it is likely too late. Any current treatments that can address advanced symptoms of neurodegenerative disease are simply beyond the means of most people. Our aim is to come up with a solution that can prevent most cases of these conditions at a cost that is manageable for as many patients as possible.""

Caffeic acid belongs to a family of compounds called polyphenols, which are plant-based compounds known for their antioxidant, or free radical-scavenging properties. Caffeic acid is unique because it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and is thus able to exert its effects upon the cells inside the brain, Narayan said.

The process the team uses to extract CACQDs from used coffee grounds is considered ""green chemistry,"" which means it is environmentally friendly. In their lab, the team ""cooks"" samples of coffee grounds at 200 degrees for four hours to reorient the caffeic acid's carbon structure and form CACQDs. The sheer abundance of coffee grounds is what makes the process both economical and sustainable, Narayan said. (ANI)

What is a ‘dopamine detox’ and how can it improve your mental health? Know from mental health experts,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Experts say that by limiting these external stimuli and letting us get bored or dissatisfied, we can control these unnatural urges to indulge in pleasure and replace them with healthy habits that are likely to make us more satisfied and happier in longer run.

""Our age of constant digital connection often overtaxes the brain’s pleasure pathways. Science indicates that activities like gaming and social media can spur harmful surges of dopamine, the neurotransmitter governing desire. This fuels shorter attention spans, impulsive behaviours, and even depression as we grow desensitized. A 'dopamine fast' offers respite by strategically limiting stimuli that drive compulsive dopamine-seeking. Taking a break from quick 'hits' of digital affirmation asks us to dive inward instead. By temporarily minimizing designated activities like causal web surfing or sugary snacks, we create space for reflection. The resulting boredom or dissatisfaction, while initially uncomfortable, can uncover deeper needs driving surface behaviours,"" says Dr Chandni Tugnait, M.D. (Alternative Medicines), Psychotherapist, Life Coach, Business Coach, NLP Expert, Healer, Founder & Director - Gateway of Healing.

""Emerging research suggests that short-term absence in fact heightens sensitivity to more meaningful rewards, like close connections, intellectual challenges, and sensorial pleasures. With more intentional living, dopamine returns to more balanced functioning. By recalibrating the reward system, dopamine fasts renew appreciation for simpler joys untouched by keyboards. Our relationships, attention spans, and sense of fulfilment stand to benefit from such digital sabbaticals,"" adds Dr Chandni.

What is a dopamine detox?

""A dopamine detox, often referred to as a 'dopamine fast', is a concept that has gained popularity in recent years as a way to reset the brain's reward system and break free from excessive stimulation. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation, and it plays a crucial role in our brain's reward pathway,"" says Dr Jyoti Kapoor, Founder-Director and Senior Psychiatrist, Manasthali.

How dopamine detox can help

Dr Chandni shares ways taking a break from screens and other such distraction can help:

Reduces overstimulation: Constant stimulation can lead to a desensitization of dopamine receptors, making it harder to find joy in simple, everyday activities. A dopamine detox can help reset these receptors.

Increases focus and productivity: By removing distractions and activities that offer instant gratification, a dopamine detox can help improve overall productivity, allowing for deeper engagement in meaningful tasks.

Promotes mindfulness: It encourages you to engage in activities that might not provide immediate pleasure but are fulfilling and enriching in the long run, such as meditation, reading, or spending time in nature.

Improves self-control and discipline: By consciously abstaining from certain activities, you can develop greater self-control and discipline, which are key aspects of emotional regulation and mental resilience.

Encourages healthier habits: It can lead to the adoption of healthier habits, as you might replace high-dopamine activities with those that are more beneficial for your mental and physical health. Some of these could revolve around immersing in nature, creative arts or building connections.

Enhances emotional stability: A detox can reduce the emotional highs and lows associated with dopamine spikes and crashes, leading to a more stable mood.

Improves quality of relationships: By reducing the time spent on digital devices, you may find more time and energy to invest in face-to-face interactions and build deeper, more meaningful relationships.

Dr Jyoti Kapoor adds more benefits of dopamine detox to the list saying it can improve mood and provides one opportunity to reflect and rejuvenate, giving a break from overstimulation.

Increased sensitivity to pleasure: By temporarily abstaining from highly stimulating activities, the brain's dopamine receptors may become more sensitive to natural, everyday pleasures. This heightened sensitivity could lead to a greater appreciation for simpler activities and a more balanced reward system.

Reduced dependence on instant gratification: Engaging in activities that provide instant gratification, such as social media scrolling or video gaming, can create a cycle of dependency. A dopamine detox aims to break this cycle, encouraging individuals to find satisfaction in activities that require patience, effort, and delayed rewards. Over time, this shift may lead to a reduced reliance on immediate sources of pleasure.

Improved mood regulation: Dopamine plays a crucial role in mood regulation, and an imbalance in its levels has been associated with mood disorders. Proponents of dopamine detoxing argue that by rebalancing the brain's reward system, individuals may experience more stable and regulated moods, reducing the likelihood of mood swings and emotional highs and lows.

Mindfulness and reflection: The break from overstimulation during a dopamine detox provides an opportunity for mindfulness and self-reflection. Engaging in activities such as meditation, journaling, or simply spending time in nature can foster a deeper connection with one's thoughts and emotions, potentially leading to a greater understanding of oneself and improved mental well-being.

""Skilful balancing is key when experimenting with dopamine fasting. The intention is not to banish all delight, but to consciously recalibrate how we process pleasure. We can reshape our neural circuitry over time. Embark by integrating small, sustainable changes before attempting stringent deprivation. Each person’s rhythm and needs differ; this practice should feel nourishing rather than punitive. Consider starting with brief, scheduled breaks from a single habit. Professional support can help craft a customized approach that suits your lifestyle. Periodic check-ins track progress and reveal which replacements feel most life-giving. It takes patience and compassion to change such engrained habits,"" concludes Dr Chandni.

Making thank you a regular phrase: When we make the practice of saying thank you at home for things that are done, children learn to be grateful and also express their gratitude to others.

Talking about gratitude: We should talk to our children about gratitude – how we are grateful for things in life and what they should be grateful for too. This will help them to value the small things in life.

Contributing to family chores: When we start involving children to help us in the family chores, they also start having the sense of belonging and contributing. This helps them to understand the importance of community building and working together.

Charity: We should teach our children to give to the underprivileged – this way they can be grateful for the life they have and also have the sense of helping others in their need.

Volunteering: We should encourage children to take part in volunteering activities – this will help them to learn to work together and contribute to a good deed.

Thanksgiving 2023: Giving thanks isn't just a holiday tradition. It's part of how humans evolved,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

How we got grateful

Humans are social animals. That's how we've lasted so long; not by being the biggest or the strongest, but by figuring out how to work together.

A key part of building relationships is the idea of reciprocity: “If you like me and do nice things for me, then I like you and do nice things for you,” said Michael Tomasello, a developmental psychologist at Duke University.

The animal kingdom has some parallel give-and-take behaviors, said Malini Suchak, an animal behavior researcher at Canisius University. In experiments with capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, Suchak found the primates became more willing to help out a partner if that individual had helped them in the past.

Some scientists think the feeling of gratitude evolved to keep the helping exchanges going. In other words, if you were helped, you'd feel like you should repay the debt with a good deed in return, said Jenae Nelson, who researches gratitude at Baylor and Harvard universities.

“This give and take — this is very, very primal and very important to a cooperative society,” Nelson said. “Otherwise, you just get a culture of takers.”

In animals and in humans, these aren't always one-to-one transactions. Sometimes, an ape that gets groomed by another will later back that partner up in a fight, Suchak said, showing that reciprocity might not be about keeping exact scores, but forming broader emotional ties.

Though we can't “speak chimp” well enough to know if they're actually saying thanks, Suchak added, it makes sense that some form of this social debt showed up early in our lineage.

“It didn't just pop out of nowhere when humans evolved,"" Suchak said.

And how we stayed grateful

Thousands of years later, gratitude has taken root in humans.

Studies have found gratitude may show up in a few spots in our genes and brains — including ones linked to social bonding, feeling reward and seeing other people's point of view.

And the feeling emerges early on: Children as young as 2 and 3 demonstrate they want to return favors, said Amrisha Vaish, who studies moral development at the University of Virginia. At age 4, children also show a tendency to “pay it forward,” she added.

In a study, Vaish found that when kids got help completing a task — in this case, finding a key to unlock a box of stickers — they were more likely to share their sticker reward with a new person.

It's that kind of behavior that shows gratitude is more than simple exchange, Schnitker said. It can make us more generous with other people in general — even if they didn't help us first.

Giving thanks might be good for you, too: A 2016 study found that people who wrote letters of gratitude reported better mental health and saw changes in their brain activity — even months down the line.

But Nelson pointed out that recognizing the giver, not just the gift, is key.

So, if Thanksgiving has you in a mood for gratitude, she suggested focusing on thanking the people in your life, rather than just making “gratitude lists” of the stuff you have. This is more in line with why the feeling evolved in the first place, she said.

“It's not just about stuff and materialism,” Nelson said. “It's about relationships, and the things that people do for you, and then the things that you can in turn do back for other people.”

Winter raises pneumonia risk; protect your lungs with these lifestyle changes,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""Often, in our quick-paced lives, the significance of health is disregarded which can be deteriorated by various factors of living. Pneumonia is a potentially serious respiratory disease that can hit anyone but is more dangerous for people whose lifestyles could compromise their immune systems. These things include stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep, among others, which all weaken our body defences making us susceptible to these diseases,"" says Dr Anjali R Nath, Consultant Pulmonologist, SPARSH Hospital, Bangalore.

What is pneumonia? Know its symptoms

For a full recovery, it's important to diagnose and treat pneumonia on time to avoid deadly complications. In winters if you are having chest discomfort, coughing, lethargy, chills, fever, vomiting, you should get immediately consult a doctor.

""An infection that inflames the air sacs in either one or both lungs is called pneumonia. This condition can commonly affect both children and adults. The indicators of pneumonia include symptoms such as chest discomfort, coughing, expectoration, lethargy, perspiration, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulties. Not treating it at the right time can lead to complications such as lung abscess,"" says Dr Samir Garde, Director of Dept of Pulmonology and Lung Transplant, Global Hospitals, Parel.

Dr Anjali says pneumonia has multiple effects on us and people who lead a sedentary or inactive lifestyle could bear the brunt of its myriad complications which could delay recovery process.

""The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in the lungs and results in cough with mucus, fever, difficulty breathing and chest pain. For those already straining their bodies with an unhealthy lifestyle, pneumonia can have an even worse impact thus leading to delayed recovery and potential complications. To avoid complications, it is important to see a doctor if you have a persistent cough accompanied by a high fever or difficulty in breathing,"" says Dr Anjali.

""Navigating the effects of pneumonia can seem quite daunting, especially when it affects a vulnerable population which is children. Heightened symptoms like fever spikes, laborious breathing, or persistent coughing can be a matter of concern for parents and they may fret about the outcome of the disease,"" says Dr Vrushali Bichkar, Consultant Paediatrician and Neonatologist, Motherhood Hospital, Lullanagar, Pune.

Lifestyle choices to reduce risk of pneumonia

There's more to reducing your risk of pneumonia than just regular hand washing and avoiding sick contacts. You must delve deeper, starting with adopting a healthier lifestyle. Include seasonal fruits, probiotics in your diet and do workout and breathing exercises for improving lung capacity.

""The core pillars of this approach include good nutrition, ample physical activity, and enough restful sleep. Eat foods such as citrus fruits, garlic, and yogurt that boost immunity and inhibit bacterial growth believed to cause pneumonia. Routine physical activity improves lung capacity. A brisk 30-minute walk or light aerobic exercise daily should do the trick. It will also be imperative for one to rest well and get a good night’s sleep of a minimum of 8 hours,"" says Dr Vrushali.

Dr Vrushali says stress is also one of the factors that make people prone to respiratory infections.

""Working towards mindfulness through meditation can help fortify your resolve in keeping up healthy customs even under duress since stressed people are particularly prone to respiratory infections! It’s time for us all to take a deep, health-replenishing breath followed by some crunching on antioxidant-rich greens and turning off late-night screens! Try to follow the instructions given by the doctor only and take medication on time. Hydration helps thin down thick mucus secretions, making it easier for little lungs to expel them while easing discomfort simultaneously. Remember this journey may appear turbulent at times but armed with these strategies and comprehensive medical intervention, the child with pneumonia can recover,"" she adds.

Agrees Dr Anjali who says pneumonia can be avoided by keeping your immune system powerful and robust. This is especially true for elderly who need to carve out a healthy routine for themselves.

""Prioritising healthy lifestyles can greatly reduce pneumonia risk. A powerful and resilient immune system comes from having fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in a balanced diet. Exercise not only improves general health but also helps the body to fight infections. Breathing exercises along with regular physical exercise also help in improving the lung capacity. While you sleep, your body renews itself; this makes adequate sleep very important. This is because chronic stress weakens the immune system. Moreover, older adults, those with underlying health problems, and people leading specific lifestyles should be more vigilant. Pneumonia has a higher chance of occurring in smokers; therefore, they have to stop smoking to maintain their respiratory health. In addition, the immune system becomes weaker due to excessive alcohol consumption hence making it susceptible to diseases,"" she adds.

Tips for treating pneumonia in children

If a child is diagnosed with pneumonia, it becomes crucial to adhere to certain important guidelines. Vaccination according to the expert’s advice is key for children and maintaining the schedule for these immunizations is critical.

""In addition, flu vaccinations should also be considered for children. Regular medical check-ups and consultations are advisable. Practicing good hand hygiene and avoiding crowded areas or contact with sick people are recommended precautions. Pneumonia patients should engage in breathing exercises to enhance lung functionality and consider practices like yoga and meditation as well. Although exposure to cold weather doesn't directly result in pneumonia it does increase vulnerability due to compromised immunity and close indoor living conditions. Avoid being near someone who is coughing or sneezing as this significantly heightens your risk of acquiring this severe illness. Implementing these sensible daily habits along with caution can significantly help in preventing pneumonia infection. Ensuring adequate sleep, regular physical activity and a nutritious diet can strengthen immunity against various diseases, conditions, allergies, and infections. Go for scanning as per the doctor's instructions. Do not venture out when the air quality is poor and there is air pollution as it can take a toll on the lungs,"" says Dr Samir.
