‘Some Pakistani players couldn’t digest my WC performance. Sudhar jao': India pacer Mohammed Shami's scathing attack,"India may have faltered in the final against Australia but they have produced some fine performances in World Cup 2023. The majority of the Indian players had a terrific tournament. The biggest proof of that was the inclusion of six Indians in ICC's World Cup 2023 XI. That is more than 50% from one team. Virat Kohli was a standout player with the bat, scoring more runs than any other player in the history of World Cups. He was rightly adjudged the Player of the Tournament for smashing 763 runs in 11 innings. There was another Indian cricketer, who was equally deserving of that award. That is Mohammed Shami. India's Mohammed Shami(PTI)

The fast bowler picked up 24 wickets, returning as the highest wicket-taker of the tournament. His tally was also the most by any Indian bowler in the history of World Cups. And Shami did all that despite not playing the first four matches of the tournament as India preferred to pick Shardul Thakur ahead of him because of the latter's batting abilities.

But as fate would have it, Hardik Pandya got injured during a league match against Bangladesh and was ruled out of the World Cup. India had no option but to switch to plan B.

They brought Suryakumar Yadav into the XI to cover for Pandya's skills and picked Shami in place of Shardul to strengthen the bowling department. Shami had an immediate impact. He picked up five wickets in his first match of this World Cup against New Zealand and never looked back.

That Shami's excellence was not limited to the cricket field alone made his performance in the World Cup even more noteworthy. When the Indian pacers were making the opposition batters dance to their tunes, brushing aside quality teams like England, Sri Lanka, and South Africa as if they were club teams, Hasan Raza, a former Pakistan cricketer came up with an absurd theory. The former batter said ICC might be giving different balls to the Indian pacers and hence they were able to extract so much movement.

Shami was the only Indian cricketer to take note of that. He shared an Instagram story lambasting the conspiracy theory. Now that the World Cup is over, Shami was once again asked about the incident and the India pacer did not hold back. ""I know I can be bitter while speaking the truth but if I don't open my mouth after all this then it won't be right,"" he said in a podcast with PUMA.

Shami launches scathing attack on ex-Pakistan player's conspiracy theory about India's performance in World Cup

""I'm not jealous of anybody. If you start enjoying the success of others then you can become a better player. I was not playing at the beginning (of the World Cup). Jab khel raha that World Cup, toh 5 wickets liye, 4 wickets aur fir se 5 wickets liye. Kuch Pakistan ke players ko ye baat hajam nahi ho rahi toh main kya karu. Kyuki unke dimaag mein ye hai ki ham best hai. Bhai best woh hota hai jo time per perform kare....aap usme controversy banaya chale ja rahe ho, ki tumhe ball kuch aur colour ki mil rahi hai..kisi aur company ki mil rahi hai....Sudhar jao yaar. (When I started playing, I picked up five wickets then got four and then another five-for. Some Pakistani players couldn't digest it. They think they are the best. The one who performs at the right time is the best. You are creating controversy for no reason. You are saying we are getting different balls, from different companies and all that. Learn your lesson),"" Shami added.

Shami also added that the legendary Wasim Akram explained the process of selecting balls in international cricket but despite that, some former cricketers said all this.

""Wasim Akram had explained how the ball is chosen. How the fourth umpire brings a box to the fielding team but despite that you say all this? It is understandable if you have not played the game at all. But when an ex-player says all these things, I don't think people would do anything else apart from laughing,"" he said.

"Avesh Khan traded to Rajasthan Royals ahead of IPL 2024 auction, Devdutt Padikkal joins Lucknow Super Giants","The Indian Premier League on Wednesday confirmed that Rajasthan Royals' (RR) star opener Devdutt Padikkal has been traded to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), while Avesh Khan, has, in turn, joined the Royals. Padikkal had represented RR in two seasons -- 2022 and 2023 -- and had started his career with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (2019-2021). Avesh had also begun his IPL career at RCB in 2017 before joining Delhi Capitals, where he spent four seasons between 2018-2021. At the mega auction preceding the 2022 edition, he was signed by LSG. Lucknow Super Giants' Avesh Khan celebrates after picking a wicket in the IPL match against Rajasthan Royals(Lucknow Super Giants Twitter)

Avesh has so far played 47 IPL matches and has 55 wickets to his name. The right-arm pacer, who represented LSG in 22 matches & picked 26 wickets after joining the franchise in 2022, was traded to RR for his existing fee (INR 10 crore). Padikkal, meanwhile, will head to LSG from RR for his existing fee (INR 7.75 crore) as well; the left-handed batter has 57 IPL matches under his belt and has scored 1521 runs, smashing a century and 9 fifties.

He represented the RR in 28 matches, scoring 637 runs.

The confirmation of the trade came shortly after Gautam Gambhir, the mentor for LSG, confirmed his departure from the franchise to reunite with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Gambhir had led the KKR to two IPL titles as captain, and is expected to join the side in a coaching role ahead of the 2024 season.

Padikkal had played in all of RR's matches in the 2022 edition when the side had reached the final of the tournament. However, the Sanju Samson-led team faced a defeat at the hands of tournament's debutants Gujarat Titans in the title clash. Padikkal had scored 376 runs in 17 matches in the edition at a strike rate of 122.88.

Avesh had a strong 2022 season in the tournament as well, picking 18 wickets in 13 matches; his impressive performances ensured him a consistent run in Team India in the shortest format, and Avesh remains a part of the squad for the upcoming T20I series against Australia.

'Need to perform when it matters...': David Warner delivers fiery '2027' response at Kaif's 'India were the best' remark,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

“Congratulations to Australia but I am not ready to accept that the best team won the World Cup. This Indian team has been the best side. They would win so many times playing against the same Australian team, even though they lost today. It was one of those bad day, this happens sometimes. ,” Kaif had said following the World Cup final on Star Sports.

Australia had lost their opening two games before kickstarting a winning streak that extended till the final of the World Cup; and the side's opener David Warner has now reacted to Kaif's claims. Warner, taking to his official X account, stated that it “doesn't matter” which team is better on the paper.

“I like MK, issue is it does not matter what’s on paper. At the end of the day you need to perform when it matters. That’s why they call it a final. That’s the day that counts and it can go either way, that’s sports. 2027 here we come,” Warner posted.

This was Warner's second ODI World Cup title, having lifted his first in 2015 under the captaincy of Michael Clarke. A host of Australian team members including Pat Cummins landed back home in the early morning hours of Wednesday. However, the Aussie T20 team will now take on India in a five-match series starting November 23; Matthew Wade will lead the side.

‘This is not 1990s. India would’ve been champions if…': Gautam Gambhir unhappy with Rahul's batting in World Cup final,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

“It's a double-edged sword. But I have always said this, the most courageous team will go on to win the World Cup. I can understand that you need time to build a partnership but 11 to 40 overs is a very, very long time. Someone should have taken that risk,” Gambhir told Sportskeeda.

‘Either we go for 150 all out or end up with 300’: Gambhir

Gambhir admitted that India could have ended up falling for a lesser score had they remained aggressive but they should've tried to score quicker regardless of that. The former opener, who scored 97 in the final of the 2011 World Cup and was instrumental to India's victory in that match, said that getting 240 should have never been an acceptable scenario.

“I would have actually liked India going really aggressive with their top 6-7 batters even if they had been all out for 150. I would have been fine. But if you feel you can defend 240 in a World Cup final...that is not where you fight. It is either this way or that. Either we go 150 all out or 300. That is where India have lacked. That is where India have not gone on to win ICC tournaments. Rohit should have sent the message before the game that even if I get out we should go aggressive,” he said.

KL Rahul and Virat Kohli put up a fourth-wicket partnership in which they played 109 balls but could score just 67 runs. While Kohli maintained a good strike rate despite the lack of boundaries, it became even more difficult for India to score after he fell on 54 off 63.

Gambhir said that Kohli had been given the role of anchoring the innings and had done it well throughout the tournament. So, other batters should have tried to play aggressively around him. Instead, Rahul ended up scoring just 66 in 107 balls.

“Kohli has played a role of anchoring the innings, but the rest all should have been aggressive. KL should have gone. What harm would it have caused? We would have been 150 all out. But had we been brave, we could scored 310 and India would have been world champions. This is not the 1990s. 240 is not a good score at all. You need 300-plus totals. India were not brave enough,” said Gambhir.

‘Lump in my throat and fire in my heart’: Gautam Gambhir returns to KKR before IPL 2024,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Speaking on his return, Gambhir said he would have a lump in his throat and fire in his heart while wearing the purple and gold jersey again. “I am not an emotional person and not many things move me. But this is different. This is back to where it all started. Today, there is a lump in my throat and fire in my heart as I think about slipping into that purple and gold jersey once again. I am not only coming back to KKR but I am coming back to the city of joy. I am back. I am hungry. I am number 23. Ami KKR,"" he said.

Welcoming Gambhir back to KKR, co-owner Shah Rukh Khan said - ""Gautam has always been part of the family and this is our Captain coming back home in a different avatar as a ""Mentor"". He was sorely missed and now we all look forward to Chandu Sir and Gautam in instilling the never-say-die spirit and of sportsmanship they stand for, in creating magic with Team KKR.""

Gambhir represented KKR 122 times - the joint second-most along with Yusuf Pathan. He is also the only KKR batter to have scored more than 3000 runs for the franchises. Gambhir amassed 3345 runs at an average of 31 and a strike rate of 124. He was instrumental in building the core of the Kolkata-based franchise. It was under his leadership that KKR roped in Sunil Narine and Andre Russell - two relatively unknown West Indies cricketers at that time who would go on to become the franchise's two most successful overseas recruits.

Narine and Russell continue to be a part of the KKR set-up. The two-time champions, however, did not have the best of seasons last year. They finished seventh in the points table with six wins in eight matches but this year, they will have the get the services of Shreyas Iyer back. Their regular captain was ruled out of the entire last season due to a back injury.

"Don't cling on to this World Cup loss your entire life: Kapil Dev breaks 'setback' shackles, lifts Team India's spirits","It's been a rough 60 hours since India's defeat in the World Cup 2023 final but the outpour of emotions, messages and wishes for Team India continues. People are disappointed but despite the heartbreak, they are making sure they get behind the 15 players who gave it their everything over the last 45 odd days. India may not have won the World Cup, leading to a nationwide-meltdown but the brand of cricket they played – winning 10 matches in a row without being challenged much – will be the Men in Blue's everlasting image from this just-concluded World Cup. Kapil Dev has wants Team India to move on following their loss to Australia in the World Cup final.(PTI )

While the players continue to be in pain, the legendary Kapil Dev has echoed the entire nation's sentiments and urged Team India to overcome the heartbreak. The post-match visuals of Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami in tears and the shattered looks on the faces of Virat Kohli, KL Rahul and everyone else was a tough pill to swallow but Kapil, India's first World Cup winning, believes sportsmen should not allow one defeat – irrespective of the magnitude – to weigh them down.

""Sportsmen have to move on. You can't cling on to one setback your entire life. Fans can do this, but not sportsmen. You have to plan for the next day. We can't undo what has happened but just keep working hard. That's what sportspersons are all about,"" Kapil, the former India all-rounder and captain, told reporters on the sidelines of an event to inaugurate the Centre for Advanced Sports Rehabilitation at BLK-Max Super-Specialty hospital.

Kapil had no shortage of words to acknowledged and appreciate the quality of cricket India played throughout the tournament. They finished the league stage unbeaten and as the top-ranked team having run opponents roughshod. Just the margin of victories – 100 runs against England, bowling South Africa out for 83 – easily made them the best team in the tournament by quite some distance. Yes, that India couldn't get over the line will pinch but there's looking back at such a marauding campaign, their hearts would fill with nothing but pride.

""I don't have to say anything. You have seen everything already. When you lose, people say all kind of things, but when they win, everything becomes quiet. That's why let us appreciate the fact that they played wonderful cricket. Yes, we couldn't cross the final hurdle but the perfect sportsman learns from this experience,"" added Kapil.

"‘If nothing happened, Shami could’ve…': Wasim Akram finds flaw in Rohit's 'out of the box thinking' in World Cup final","A fast-scoring World Cup had an anticlimactic finish as Travis Head-inspired Australia crushed a free-scoring India in a low-scoring final. With India suffering another World Cup heartbreak, legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram questioned Rohit Sharma's 'out of the box thinking' after the summit clash of the 50-over spectacle. Ending India's unbeaten run at the One Day International (ODI) World Cup 2023, Pat Cummins' Australia silenced the partisan crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium with a six-wicket win over the Men In Blue. Wasim Akram opined that Rohit Sharma's Team India panicked in the World Cup 2023 final(Getty Images-PTI)

After smashing a gigantic total in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, Rohit's Team India only mustered 240 in the final. Defending the below-par total against the record-time winners, skipper Rohit opted to unleash Mohammed Shami in the second over instead of strike bowler Mohammed Siraj. Though an in-form Shami took the new ball and bagged the all-important wicket of David Warner, the speedster failed to inspire India to a historic win over the Aussies.

'Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs'

Speaking to Sportskeeda about India's approach to attacking the Australian bowlers, Akram opined that Rohit and Co. 'panicked' during the final. “They panicked a bit. I understand that he [Shami] has dismissed many left-handers and has bowled brilliantly from round the wicket. Travis Head survived against him. You must have noted that Shami bowled a couple of wide balls. I feel Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs at the start just because of his swing,” Akram said.

'Out of the box thinking' from Rohit

“Psychologically, Shami knew that he comes first change, so the ball is controllable as it is a little old. Giving him the new ball in the World Cup final, out of the box thinking, I am all for it. But, Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs at the start. If nothing had happened, Shami could have been brought on,” Akram added.

Shami bowled seven overs and leaked 47 runs while Siraj recorded identical figures (1 for 45) with the ball as both pacers shared only two wickets in the final. Riding on Head's 137-run off 120 balls, Australia chased down the 240-run target in 43 overs. Head's brilliant century and Marnus Labuschagne's patient knock of 58 propelled Australia to its sixth World Cup crown in Ahmedabad.

'Was Rohit being too greedy? Could he not have curbed himself?': Gavaskar on India captain's wicket in World Cup final,"If there was one turning point in the World Cup 2023 final that put paid to India's chances, it was Rohit Sharma's dismissal. Before his wicket, India were cruising, scoring at almost nine runs an over and had blazed away, as usual, to 76/2 in 9.4 overs. But the moment Rohit was out to that brilliant piece of catching from Travis Head, it was as if the wheels just fell off. From smashing eight fours and three sixes in the first 10 overs, to just four across the next 40, India simply never recovered, and eventually paid the price. Rohit Sharma leaves the field after losing his wicket(AP)

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has made an interesting point about Rohit's dismissal. The India captain, facing the second over from Glenn Maxwell had already launched him for a six and a four off the previous two balls, making it a 10-run over with three balls to go, and Gavaskar feels he could have done without taking any further risks. The wicket spelled doom and India ended up with just 240, a target which Australia gunned down with Head adding to the home team's woes by blasting a cracking century as the Aussies cantered home by six wickets and 7 overs left.

""Travis Head's superlative turning and running back catch dashed India’s hopes of getting a 300-plus score. That catch dismissed Rohit Sharma, who once again stormed his way to another quickfire 40-plus. That wicket fell in the final over of the first Powerplay where there are only two fielders allowed outside the 30-metre circle. He had already hit a six and a four in the over and was obviously trying to capitalise on the few deliveries left before the Powerplay finished. Was he being too greedy? Could he not have curbed himself since Shubman Gill had already been dismissed?"", Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.

But that's how Rohit has played the entire tournament. The knock of 47 off 31 balls was his fifth dismissal in the 40s, which indicates his role throughout the World Cup has been of an aggressor, an enforcer. That the rest of the Indian batter slowed down is on them, even as Virat Kohli and KL Rahul did their best with half-centuries before eventually shutting shop. Australia read the conditions brilliantly, using the slowness of the surface and squeezing 10 overs between Head, Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh. Had it not been for Rohit’s dismissal, who knows… maybe India could have out on a bit more. Another 30 runs, and it could well have made the difference in India's confidence and the outcome as a whole.

""The fifth bowler's quota for Australia was always a bit of a lottery, and this time, it worked as it not only got the crucial wicket of the Indian captain but also made the other India batters play the non-regular bowlers even more carefully, and thereby lose out on perhaps 30 runs at least. Whether those runs would have made the difference is debatable,"" Gavaskar pointed out.

‘All stats said bat first…’: Warner reveals why Australia opted to bowl after winning toss in World final vs India,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

“They were discussing it the night before for a good hour and a half or two hours about what to do.” Warner told South Africa great AB de Villiers on the latter's Youtube channel. “All the stats coming through was saying, bat first and put runs on the board. But for once, when we got all got asked that question, I think a majority of us said let's just chase.”

Warner said that the team decided it is better to understand the conditions thoroughly before walking out to bat and the situation would be helped if they did well with the ball. “If we bowl well and understand the conditions like that, we can then chase and then anchor,” he said.

India were all out for 240, with Australia starving them out after they shot off 80 runs in the first 10 overs. While Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami then got the hosts off to a promising start in their defence, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne shut the door with 192-run stand. Head scored 137 in 120 balls while Labuschagne was unbeaten on 58 off 110 and Australia took the match by six wickets. Warner said that Labuschagne's innings was exactly the kind of thing they hoped they would be able to do if their plan of bowling first paid off.

“What Marnus did was absolutely perfect. You look at when we played India in the first game. I think they were 3/4 (2/3) but then Virat did what he does, KL Rahul as well. They were ice calm. When you know what to get, your best batters generally thrive. They will play the tempo of the game,” said Warner, referring to the first match of the tournament between Australia and India. At the time, India had blown Australia away for 199 but were themselves reduced to two runs for the loss of three wickets. However, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul then put up a 165-run stand that ended any chances that the Australians had.

“That was Pat Cummins' best spell of the tournament”

Warner was all praise for Cummins for the way he led the team in the tournament and the way he seeded doubts in the minds of the Indian batters with his tactics in the final. “He has been so calm the whole time. He was criticised in England for his fielding placements, being defensive and all that. Here as well, he cops it again for the slow start. It's not fair. I get that as a captain he is leading the ship but as a whole unit, we take responsibility ourselves. Yesterday was a testament to that in terms of the way we went about it,” he said.

Warner also said that Cummins's spell itself was the best he had seen from him in the entire tournament. Cummins recorded figures of 2/34, getting the key wickets of Shreyas Iyer and Kohli. “Yesterday was unbelievable the way he bowled. That was his best spell in the entire tournament. The great players stand up when it's time to deliver and yesterday he did that,” said Warner.

Suryakumar Yadav looks to shine the light on his talent again,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The opponents, Australia, will be familiar yet unfamiliar. Many of their ace players have gone back home but they still have seven from their ODI champions’ squad; that includes a certain Travis Head. It is a series that many (players and fans) would have perhaps preferred to sit out but those who have been named, on both sides, have a job to do.

That’s professional sport and poor scheduling for you.

“It is difficult,” said Yadav ahead of the first T20I. “It will take time. You can’t just get up the next morning and forget everything else. Obviously, we would have loved to win but then, as you say, when you get up next morning, there is sunlight again... light at the end of the tunnel. You have to forget and move on.""

And what does moving on truly mean for Surya? He has been India's breakout star in T20 cricket for a while now but as the World Cup final showed all those watching, ODIs aren’t his cup of tea. On a slowish wicket, he struggled to play with the belligerence we have come to associate with his batting. He got stuck, as did India.

To many this was why India should have perhaps considered Ishan Kishan as an option. The left-hander would have perhaps presented a different problem to the Aussies. At this point though, all those thoughts are little more than the ‘what ifs’ that accompany every failure.

The numbers have been repeated often enough in the recent past but are worth putting out again: in 37 ODIs, Surya averages 25.8 at a strike-rate of 105 whereas in 53 T20Is, he averages 46.0 at a strike-rate 172.7. The difference is stark and illustrates why he is widely regarded as a side character in ODIs but a bona fide star in T20 cricket.

His endeavour will be to try and take the handbrakes off in a format he clearly gets. The muddled thinking that plagues him in ODIs miraculously clears up in the shortest format and India and Surya are both the better for it. No one blames anyone for playing shots in T20 cricket and that is what Surya, the skipper, is preaching to his team as well.

“Let’s be very selfless when you go onto the field because I am a guy that doesn’t think too much about personal milestones instead of the team’s goal,” said Surya. “I have always told them you need to keep the team’s goal first. I have played a lot of times with them in the IPL and few India games as well. It wasn’t that difficult and it is really exciting to get back onto the field.”

The excitement is a mix of real and imagined but with the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled in June 2024, every match still has some value, though one reckons that IPL 2024 will be the real deal breaker.

“Keeping the T20 World Cup in mind, games that we play up to them are very important,” said Surya. “My message to them is very clear, ‘just be fearless’. They are in good nick, the team management tells me, and I have told them to enjoy their time in the middle, not do anything different as at the end of the day, this is just another game of cricket.”

Just another game of cricket, indeed. Nothing like the previous one he played.

Haris Rauf's PCB contract could be revised after refusing to play Tests in Australia,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The 'Category A' has only three players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Afridi.

A reliable source said that some senior officials in the Pakistan Cricket Board were unhappy at the attitude of Haris and also over the statements made by his Lahore Qalandars coach Aqib Javed, who defended the express pace bowler.

Pakistan’s new chief selector Wahab Riaz hit out at Haris on Monday for first agreeing to be considered for the Tests in Australia before making himself unavailable two days later citing workload and fitness concerns.

Wahab, himself a fast bowler who appeared in three World Cups, made it clear that being a centrally contracted player, Haris should have been available for the Test series.

“I and the Director of Pakistan team, Muhammad Hafeez, we went and spoke to him in detail and told him that both the captain and coach wanted him (Haris) to play in Australia as he was an impact bowler and we assured him he would not bowl more then 10-12 overs in a day in Australia,” Wahab had said at his press conference while announcing the squad for Australia.

“We also spoke to the team physio and trainer and they said Haris had no fitness issues and there would be no problem with him in Australia,” Wahab said.

Hours later sources quoting Haris in the Pakistan media said he had never made himself available for the Tests and had told the selectors he wanted to focus on white ball cricket and manage his workload.

But the source said that the very fact that Haris didn’t come out with a denial directly had convinced the senior board officials he was playing games with the board and selectors.

“There has been discussion that if Haris is only focussed on white ball cricket then the central contact given to him also needs to be reviewed since he was placed in category B which carries a monthly retainer of over 4 million rupees plus enhanced match fees, bonuses and a share in the PCB’s share of ICC revenues.

“Those players were given top two categories who were considered all format players,” the source said.

He said it could be expected that the board might either ask Haris for his final decision on red ball cricket and revise his contract and the player also has the option of going freelance and returning the central contract to the board like other international players including Trent Bolt, Jason Roy etc.

“A NOC for playing in the Big Bash could also be withheld by the board,” the source added.

The source said that both Hafeez and Wahab had conveyed their disappointment over Haris' attitude to the PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf.

Haris played one Test back in December against England in Rawalpindi where he bowled just 13 overs before getting injured.

India mourning World Cup loss face Aussies again in T20 series,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

A breathing space of at least 10 days would have helped Indian fans who were emotionally invested in the spectacular World Cup run for 45 days only to be left dejected. That only two journalists attended the news conference of Suryakumar Yadav, leading the side, in Vizag on Wednesday suggested a distinct lack of interest.

While most of India’s World Cup squad will take a break, the Australia players are more affected by the packed scheduling. Almost half the players from the winning side, including Travis Head, the batting hero of the final and semi-final, are staying back.

A World Cup win deserves a grand public celebration back home, a once in a lifetime chance to soak in the adulation. But Head admitted he will return to Australia only 12 days after the World Cup victory. Glenn Maxwell, Adam Zampa and Steve Smith are also among those who have stayed back for the T20 series.

This begs the question, when finalising the dates, how could the two cricket boards not have considered the prospect of their teams going all the way?

Besides Yadav, Ishan Kishan and Prasidh Krishna from the Cup squad will have to lift their energy levels. Ishan played two games and Prasidh none, but they were with the team since the Asia Cup preparatory camp.

NO HERO’S RETURN FOR HEAD

Save a thought for Head, the player of the final, who will have to refocus on the bilateral series instead of savouring his achievement. Celebrations and farewells are all about timing. It has no value if that moment is lost. You don’t have an open-top bus parade two weeks later, for example.

Head is not as high profile as Smith or Maxwell, and his moments under the sun have been few. Instead of touching down in Australia to a hero’s welcome, he will return only after the series ends on December 3.

The T20 series has also resulted in a low-key return for the rest of the Australia ODI squad. “We've all split off our own different ways, there’s T20s coming up, some guys are on aeroplanes at the moment getting home as well,” wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey told reporters on landing in Adelaide. “It’s probably pretty odd scheduling now that you look at it, to win a World Cup and a few days later you’re playing again.”

The Australia ODI team next plays only in February, against West Indies. According to reports, Cricket Australia has planned a public celebration when the Test squad assembles in Perth on the December 9-10 weekend for the first Test against Pakistan, though Maxwell, Zampa and Inglis may miss that function too as they will be with their Big Bash League teams.

Ultimately cricket is about commerce, but even from the viewers’ point of view, it amounts to overkill. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan, who was in India as an expert during the World Cup, called the T20 series “complete greed and overkill”.

“Why can't we allow players the chance to have a moment’s rest after a WC or whoever wins the chance to celebrate properly for a couple of weeks,” he wrote on X.

The same thing happened to the India players after their 2011 ODI World Cup victory. They had just a six-day break after Cup final on April 2 before IPL started. It gave MS Dhoni’s side hardly any time to savour the win. That was at least franchise cricket, but this is national team duty straightaway.

T20 WORLD CUP BUILD-UP

The series will start the build-up to next year’s T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA. For India’s young players, it will be an opportunity to impress the selectors against a strong Australia.

The focus will on Surya, who gets his favoured platform after the disappointment in the final. He will lead India for the first time. His Mumbai Indians teammate, Ishan Kishan too has the chance to prove he is an effective T20 bat in international cricket after underwhelming efforts in his last few T20I series. In eight games in 2023, he averages 12.13 at a strike rate of 89.81.

Axar Patel, who missed the World Cup due to a quadriceps strain, is back and will be hungry to prove himself as he competes with Ravindra Jadeja for the spin-bowling all-rounder's spot.

Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Arshdeep Singh and Ravi Bishnoi have done well in the opportunities they have got. They will have to make their chances count against a strong Australia.

"Virat Kohli moves to third spot in ODI rankings, three Indian batters in top four","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

While Gill has 826 points, Pakistan batter Babar Azam is second with 824 points and Kohli now has 791 points.

India captain Rohit Sharma, who gave his side an explosive start in almost every outing. also jumped one spot and is now placed fourth with 769 rating points. India now have three batters in the top four of the ODI rankings. Rohit smashed 597 runs and he and Kohli were the two leading run scorers of the tournament.

Gill, who missed a few matches, amassed 354 runs in the showpiece event and Babar scored 320 runs as Pakistan failed to qualify for the semi-final of the tournament.

Meanwhile, South Africa opener Quinton de Kock, who has announced retirement from the format, slipped two spots to fifth, while New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell jumped five spots to sixth. He scored 134(119) against India in the semi-final and amassed 552 runs at the World Cup.

Australia's World Cup winner, Travis Head witnessed a massive climb in his rankings. He jumped 28 spots to 15th overall after his match-winning performance in the summit clash against India.

If we shift our focus to the bowlers, South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj sits at the top, with a slew of Australian players making inroads following their World Cup triumph.

Josh Hazlewood has moved up four places to second overall, while Mitchell Starc moved up eight places to 12th and skipper Pat Cummins moved up seven places to 27th.

Mohammed Siraj (third) and Jasprit Bumrah (fourth) stay in the top ten for ODI bowlers but teammate Kuldeep Yadav dipped one spot to tie sixth.

Surprisingly, Shami slipped to 10th position with 648 points from earlier 657.

'Odd scheduling': India series puts dampener on Australia's World Cup celebrations,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

It was a far cry from some of the raucous ticker-tape parades enjoyed by victorious Australian cricket teams of yesteryear. ""We've all split off our own different ways, there's T20s coming up, some guys are on aeroplanes at the moment getting home as well,"" wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey told reporters on arrival home in Adelaide.

He added: ""It's probably pretty odd scheduling now that you look at it, to win a World Cup and a few days later you're playing again.""

India have named an almost completely different squad for the series, which starts in Visakhapatnam and then goes to four different venues, concluding in Bengaluru on December 3.

Suryakumar Yadav will captain for the first time, in the absence of Rohit Sharma, and is one of only three players retained from India's World Cup squad.

Former England skipper Michael Vaughan was much less diplomatic than Carey about the prospect of India and Australia meeting again so soon.

After Australia's veteran opener David Warner withdrew from the series on Tuesday, Vaughan wrote on social media: ""As all the players who won the World Cup should.

""They should have been pulled out to allow them time to recover but importantly get back to Oz to enjoy the celebrations.""

Vaughan, who is now a high-profile pundit, was even more forthright last week, calling the series ""complete greed and overkill"".

""Why can't we allow players the chance to have a moment's rest after a WC or whoever wins the chance to celebrate properly for a couple of weeks,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. The World Cup trophy has remained in India and will not be reunited with captain Cummins -- who has this year also guided Australia to win the World Test Championship and retain the Ashes -- until next week, The Age newspaper said.

"Magic moments win tournaments, India’s were all before the final","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Early in West Indies’ run chase, Balwinder Singh Sandhu clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a banana inswinger.

A little while later came another moment of magic. Rampaging Viv Richards, threatening to destroy India’s bowling and win the match on his own, hit Madan Lal high between square leg and mid-wicket which Kapil Dev, running behind 20-25 yards keeping his eyes on the ball over his shoulder, converted into a stunning catch.

Richards’s dismissal for 33 opened up a match that till that point had been one-sided. The West Indies innings lost rhythm, wickets started falling, and overhauling a paltry 183, which looked a cakewalk at the halfway stage, became a mountain too high to climb. India won by 43 runs.

I’ve dwelt at some length on the 1983 final because it resonates most strongly in the Indian context. There are several other such examples in World Cup history.

The 1975 final is widely remembered for Clive Lloyd, hitting the ball like a lumberjack, scoring a powerful 102. But the moments of magic came from 23-year-old Viv Richards, in his first year in international cricket, running out three batsmen with his alacrity in the field and pinpoint accuracy of his throws, to scuttle the Aussie run chase.

In the 1992 final, Pakistan were defending a not-so-large score. England looked to be chasing the target serenely till the magical over from Wasim Akram in which he got the set Allan Lamb and dangerous Chris Lewis off successive deliveries to turn the match on its head.

In 2015, Mitchell Starc bowled New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who had been in dazzling form till then, in the first over, and the Kiwis floundered after this body blow.

In 2019, in the semi-final against New Zealand, India were odds-on favourites. But in a match which got extended into the second day because of inclement weather, they suffered a shock defeat chasing a modest target. An incisive opening spell by Trent Boult and Matt Henry saw India lose 3 wickets – including Rohit and Virat – in a jiffy, and all hopes of reaching the final went kaput.

Sometimes moments of magic for one team coincide with moments of madness for the opposition. In the ODI World Cup 1996 semi-final at Mohali, West Indies were cruising to victory at 165-3 chasing 207, but collapsed sensationally for 202 against Shane Warne.

In the 1999 semi-final between Australia and South Africa, the latter inexplicably stumbled a second time. Herschelle Gibbs first didn’t complete a catch of Steve Waugh, allowing him to make a gritty half-century to win the Super Six game. Then, while chasing 213 in the semis, last man Allan Donald was run out in a crazy mix-up with Lance Klusener with the scores tied. Australia went through to the final because they finished higher in the Super Six stage.

In highlighting these incidents, I don’t mean to suggest that knockout matches and finals are won or lost only on moments of magic or madness. In all cases of teams that have won major tournaments in limited overs cricket, sustained excellence over a period of time, tenacity and ambition are crucial. However, moments of magic are triggers that can swerve, swing and spin a match away from an anticipated course and lead to an unexpected result.

In Sunday’s final, there was one acutely magical moment. It belonged to Australia when Travis Head ran back 25-30 yards, looked over his shoulder to judge the trajectory of the ball, and dive full-length forward to hold a catch that dismissed Rohit Sharma. Rohit looked in stupendous touch till then and good enough to take the game away from Australia. His dismissal changed the momentum and trend of play, arguably even the result.

Head was not done for the day. In the run chase he tamed India’s vaunted pacers and scored heavily against spinners with strokes of guts and inventiveness to lead his team to a fantastic win. It was a tour de force performance by a player who had only just made it to the tournament at the halfway stage.

In terms of quality of cricket India were undoubtedly the best side in the tournament. Till the final. That’s where the champion team is decided. India failed this test.

The tenor and texture of India’s campaign reveals the depth and quality of talent in India. In a way. It also creates a template that can make India a more creative and stronger force in limited overs cricket. However, this still doesn't answer whether India can win tournaments consistently.

That, agonisingly, is still to be learnt.

ICC bans transgender players from international women's cricket in major policy decision,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""The new policy is based on the following principles (in order of priority), protection of the integrity of the women's game, safety, fairness and inclusion, and this means any Male to Female participants who have been through any form of male puberty will not be eligible to participate in the international women's game regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken.""

Gender reassignment and treatment have been a hotly-debated topic in world athletics for years. ICC arrived at the decision at its Board meeting in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. Asked what was the trigger for ICC to bring about this change, a source said it was due to ""cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Olympics.""

""Since cricket will be an Olympic sport, it has to be governed by the Olympic guidelines. This gender issue is a huge one at global level. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has changed regulations and advised sports to implement regulations that are suitable for their sport, which is what we have done,"" said an ICC source.

World Athletic (WA), the governing body for track and field and other running competitions, had also barred transgender women, who went through male puberty, from competing in women's events at international competitions. The policy took effect on 31 March, 2023.

WA also ruled that to compete as a woman, athletes must have a testosterone level below 2.5 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) for at least 24 months before an international competition.

South African runner Caster Semeneya was barred from competing precisely for this reason as testosterone level in her body were more than the prescribed limit.

World governing bodies for cycling (UCI) and swimming (FINA) had also introduced the same regulation in their sport while World Rugby has an outright ban on trans women in international women's rugby.

The ICC, while firming up rules for gender eligibility for international women's cricket, left the issue at the domestic level in the hands of the member boards.

""The review, which was led by the ICC Medical Advisory Committee chaired by Dr Peter Harcourt, relates solely to gender eligibility for international women's cricket, whilst gender eligibility at domestic level is a matter for each individual Member Board, which may be impacted by local legislation. The regulations will be reviewed within two years,"" said the ICC.

ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said the world governing body had arrived at the decision following ""extensive consultations"".

""The changes to the gender eligibility regulations resulted from an extensive consultation process and is founded in science and aligned with the core principles developed during the review.

""Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women's game and the safety of players,"" said Allardice.

Meanwhile, the Chief Executives' Committee (CEC) endorsed a plan to accelerate the development of women match officials, which includes equal match-day pay for ICC umpires across men's and women's cricket, and ensuring there is one neutral umpire in every ICC Women's Championship series from January next year.

"Hat-trick of gut-wrenching defeats for Dravid, Rohit","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

In 2011, MS Dhoni’s India lost one and tied one league match, only to bring their A game in the three back-to-back knockout matches as India triumphed for the second time. That’s also what Pat Cummins-led Australia have been able to do.

Spectacular as the class of 2023 was, it will be a mere addition to the list of Indian sides that failed to cross the final hurdle. It’s now been nine ICC events in ten attempts where India have failed to boss the knockout rounds. They were eliminated in the group stages at the 2021 T20 World Cup. For Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid, brought together to win ICC trophies, have steered India through dominant league stage performances in three tournaments. Unfortunately, each time, across three formats in their two years together, the title remains elusive.

Dravid would not have signed up for the job promising trophies. He understands the vagaries of sport too well and philosophises losses even better. “It's tough…but that's sport. It can happen. The sun will come up tomorrow morning,” he said in Ahmedabad on Sunday. “We'll learn from it. We’ll reflect.”

When he and Sharma, who Dravid said “gave a lot of his personal time and energy to the campaign”, sit out to reflect calmly, they will wonder if any of their plans could have been different. “I didn't feel at any stage going into this game that there were any nerves or the guys were intimidated,” Dravid said.

What if Rohit had won the toss and bowled first? Runs on the board though is never a bad ploy in a final. But ow could Cummins and the Aussie think-tank read the foreign pitch so accurately? It seemed Australia knew well considering how they dried up India’s runs in the middle overs and coasted to victory, taming the tournament’s most successful bowling attack under lights.

There is still no unanimity over what the par score would have been. Rohit said 30-40 more runs would have been good. Cummins said even “300 might have been tough but achievable”. The Aussie skipper might have been just rubbing it in. But could India’s batters have strived to put the Australia bowlers off in the middle overs?

“We lost wickets just when we felt we built a partnership and we can start going,” said Dravid. He didn’t agree that those partnerships, till the time wickets fell, were too defensive – India scored just two boundaries and scored at 3.9 runs per over between overs 11-40. To another question, he said India “managed (with five bowlers) pretty well, except for probably this final”. Perhaps, the batting group was worried, not just about the long tail but how productive batters Nos. 6 and 7 would be without the injured Hardik Pandya.

Mohammed Shami’s around the wicket record against left-handers may have tempted Rohit to hand him the new ball against Travis Head and Dave Warner, but they may, on hindsight, agree with former Aussie skipper Ricky Ponting’s comment that Mohammed Siraj was rendered ineffective coming on second change. Head’s sensational century then stole the match away.

The explosive left-hander had much the same way taken the World Test Championship final away from India’s grasp on Day 1. That was only five months ago when India’s pacers, without Jasprit Bumrah, allowed Head safe passage without testing him with short balls, seen as his technical weakness. “There was a debate if we should go short and whether the wet Dukes ball would swing. It was decided that the bowlers should bowl full,’ a team member had said after the Oval loss.

Bowling coach Paras Mhambrey had later said it was skipper Rohit’s instinctive call to delay bowling bouncers (Head batted at No.5 and top-scored with 163 off 174 balls). Fine margins, which can prove costly in matches where you see the exit door from the corner of your eye.

It’s widely acknowledged that Indian batters were tame in the T20 World Cup semi-final against England in 2022. Rohit’s decision to go the aggressive route in the powerplays in this World Cup may have stemmed from the manner of that defeat at Adelaide. He walked the talk even in the final, scoring at a strike rate of 151. One will never know if the rest of India’s batters could have done more.

'Will Rohit Sharma be playing or…': Sreesanth picks Team India's squad for next ICC World Cup,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

ALSO READ: Suryakumar Yadav to lead India in Australia series, Shreyas Iyer will join squad as vice-captain for last 2 T20Is

‘Will Rohit be playing or not is a big question’

Making an early prediction for next year's World Cup, former Indian pacer Shanthakumaran Nair Sreesanth feels the 2007 champions will have either Rohit or Hardik Pandya at the helm. India made it to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup under Rohit's leadership in 2022. ""Will Rohit Sharma be playing or not is a big question. He'll be captain because he has won all those IPLs. Either Rohit Sharma or Hardik Pandya will be captain depending on the situation, the surroundings,"" Sreesanth told Sportskeeda.

‘Rishabh Pant should be there as third keeper’

The former India pacer also believes that superstar Rishabh Pant will be fit for selection as the third wicketkeeper at the T20 World Cup. Pant missed major marquee events after suffering multiple injuries in a serious car crash last year. ""Rishabh Pant, if he's fit should be there as the third keeper because he might need some time to come back to the setup. We need a match-winner, not someone who just sticks around. We need a player who is ready to play and win matches. That's as of now. He might be the second or first wicketkeeper depending on form,"" Sreesanth added.

Sreesanth picks his India's preliminary squad for T20 World Cup:

Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Mohammed Shami, Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj.
