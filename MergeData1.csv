Lana Del Rey says she's ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½absolutely not in loveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ after recen,"American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey has opened up on her recent heartbreak. The 38-year-old artist got candid about being in love and falling out of it in a tell-all interview with Harper's Bazaar. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½m definitely not in love right now. No, absolutely not in love. Have been, but no,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the Summertime Sadness hitmaker declared. Lana also explained what caused the rift between her and her recent ex-boyfriend. Lana Del Rey is not in love anymore(YouTube)
Recalling the days leading up to her breakup, the Say Yes To Heaven singer said that her former boyfriend didn't like her house and they had several fights over it. Apparently, the simplicity of the pop icon's house is not easy to digest for some. Lana revealed that many people have shown their contempt for her house. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We had some fights over this house, a couple people,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said, adding, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They didn't get it.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I feel like even the most chill guy doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t really want to chill here,ï¿½ï¿½ene. Lana then expressed her shock over her recent breakup, saying, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sadly, part of you knows ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that ainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t it. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ That one shocked me.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ She added, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t name names and whatever, but that one really shocked me, that person.

"Coldplay concert in Malaysia could be stopped via ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½kill switchï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ if the band misbehaves, gov","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Communication and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil said he doesn't foresee any problem with Coldplay's first concert in Malaysia later in the night. Security has been beefed up for the show that is expected to draw some 75,000 people at a stadium outside Kuala Lumpur.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yes, it's one of the things we have discussed with the organizer,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Fahmi said when asked if a "" to cut off power supply will be used.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The prime minister has also said the band, you know, is very supportive of Palestine. So, we are upbeat about the concert today,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he added.
Malaysia introduced the kill switch measure recently after a controversy sparked by British band The 1975 in Kuala Lumpur in July. The band's lead singer slammed the countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s anti-gay laws and kissed a male bandmate during their performance, sparking a backlash among Muslims and prompted the government to cut short a three-day music festival.
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has justified allowing the Coldplay concert, telling Parliament on Tuesday that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Coldplay is actually among the bands"" He noted that the previous administration, before he took power in November 2022, had approved the concert. Anwar said pro-Palestinian groups also approached his office in support of the Coldplay concert.
The opposition Islamic party PAS slammed Anwar's stance. While Coldplay supports the Palestinian cause, it also encourages hedonism, said its information chief Ahmad Fadhli Shaari.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is not about whether they purely support the Palestinian cause or not but the issue of hedonism culture that they bring to our community,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said Tuesday in Parliament. PAS, which has expanded its influence following strong Muslim support in the 2022 elections, often protests concerts by international artists that it said were incompatible with Muslim values.
Officials from concert organizer Live Nation Malaysia couldn't be immediately reached for comment. It issued a statement to concert-goers a few days ago, reminding them to be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mindful of local cultures and sensitivitiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and refrain froems that may cause discomfort to others.
Police have warned the public to refrain from any sort of provocation and inciting unrest at the concert, which is part of Coldplay's Music of the Spheres World Tour.
Coldplay also met with resistance from Muslims when they performed in Indonesia earlier this month. Protesters held rallies right up to the day of its concert, slamming the band as an LGBTQ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½propagandistï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ whose stance damages ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½faith and morals.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Coldplay is renowned for interlacing its values with its shows, such as the bandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s push for environmental sustainability. Lead singer Chris Martin has been known to wear rainbow colors and wave gay pride flags during performances.

He goes on, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Unko realize hua ki ye live art hi form hai aur ye Youtube par dekhne wali cheez nahi hai. And sheerly through word of mouth, we have reached to a place where we are organising these events at such grand venues with capacity to accommodate more and more people.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Some time back, talking on the same lines, comedian and Emmy winner Vir Das had also shared on Instagram that comedy wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t considered a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½theatrical art formï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ until two years ago and auditorium owners would not give their place to comedians. Bassi also agrees with Dasï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ comment and goes on to point out how there is another reason behind comedians finally being able to perform on bigger stages and are given the due respect.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Comedians earlier were not able to afford the cost of these auditoriums. But now, as people want to come and witness the live performance, I could increase the ticket prices. People are willing to spend money to watch my show.  Mat) is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½3500 approximately and people donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mind paying for it. I am able to afford the expenses of the sound recording, the stadium and more. Auditorium owner donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mind anything as long as they are paid,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ shares Bassi who was seen in Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar recently alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor.
While he is at the top of his career, enjoying the brighter side of the showbiz, is he ready to face the downfall as and when it comes? But Bassi has no fears about it. Confidently he tells us, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I am not afraid of it because I understand that it will happenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that time will comeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½one day or the other. I know mera waqt khatam hojaaega aur naye artistes aajaenge. But jitna maine life me achieve kara hai, agar wo chala bhi jaaega toh mujhe ye satisfaction rahegi ki maine apne time acche""
""So I am grateful for all the love and appreciation coming my way, but I cannot become greedy and expect to get the same level of it throughout my life,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Bassi ends.

""We will worry for our global Jewish family and also hurt for the innocent Palestinians used as human shields by Hamas. We will work to eviscerate Hamas and also pray for a free and flourishing Gaza,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she added.
She conti""We will remember and work for the release of the 240 hostages, as well as for the safety of the 2.2 million Gazans also held hostage by Hamas.

Where is Yuta in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime?,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

In this article, we will explore Why he is not fighting alongside his friends and allies in Shibuya? What is he hiding or waiting for?

During the Jujutsu Kaisen anime events, where is Yuta Okkotsu's?

Yuta, the second-year student enrolled at Tokyo's Jujutsu High, stands out as a formidable sorcerer within the Jujutsu Kaisen series. His potential is acknowledged by Gojo, the preeminent sorcerer of the current era and Yuta's mentor. Gojo foresees the possibility that Yuta may eventually rival or even surpass him in sorcery.

Initially introduced in the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie, which predates the events portrayed in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, this film delves into Yuta's backstory, unveiling the inception of his journey as a sorcerer. Notably, it uncovers Yuta's lineage, tracing his ancestry to Michizane Sugawara, one of the Big Three Vengeful Spirits, establishing a distant connection to the Gojo Clan.

The movie reaches its pinnacle with an intense and flashy confrontation between Yuta and Geto, culminating in Geto's defeat and demise. Subsequently, in a post-credits scene, Yuta is seen relishing local cuisine in Africa, accompanied by Miguel, a foreign sorcerer who had previously clashed with Gojo during Geto's assault on Tokyo, known as the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons.

It is later revealed that Yuta embarked on a journey to Africa to undergo training and study under Miguel in the latter's homeland. Impressively, Yuta and Miguel make an appearance together in the second opening of Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, hinting that they are still in Africa honing their skills.

Yuta's debut is approaching in Jujutsu Kaisen anime

Yuta's entrance into the Jujutsu Kaisen manga unfolds in Chapter 137 during Yuji Itadori's Extermination Arc. Following his return to Tokyo, Yuta is tasked by the Jujutsu society's authorities with the mission to eliminate Itadori.

Bound by a compelling commitment to the higher-ups, Yuta engages in a fierce battle with Itadori, ultimately appearing to fatally wound him by thrusting a blade through his heart. However, the truth behind this intense confrontation gradually surfacesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½it was a calculated facade orchestrated to safeguard Itadori from the stringent, traditionalist leaders within the Jujutsu society.

Fans can expect Yuta will make his highly anticipated anime debut towards the end of the Season 2 or at the outset of the Season 3.

ýýýSome Pakistani players couldnýýýt digest my WC performance. Sudhar jao': India pacer Mohammed Shami's scathing attack,"India may have faltered in the final against Australia but they have produced some fine performances in World Cup 2023. The majority of the Indian players had a terrific tournament. The biggest proof of that was the inclusion of six Indians in ICC's World Cup 2023 XI. That is more than 50% from one team. Virat Kohli was a standout player with the bat, scoring more runs than any other player in the history of World Cups. He was rightly adjudged the Player of the Tournament for smashing 763 runs in 11 innings. There was another Indian cricketer, who was equally deserving of that award. That is Mohammed Shami. India's Mohammed Shami(PTI)
The fast bowler picked up 24 wickets, returning as the highest wicket-taker of the tournament. His tally was also the most by any Indian bowler in the history of World Cups. And Shami did all that despite not playing the first four matches of the tournament as India preferred to pick Shardul Thakur ahead of him because of the latter's batting abilities.
But as fate would have it, Hardik Pandya got injured during a league match against Bangladesh and was ruled out of the World Cup. India had no option but to switch to plan B.
They brought Suryakumar Yadav into the XI to cover for Pandya's skills and picked Shami in place of Shardul to strengthen the bowling department. Shami had an immediate impact. He picked up five wickets in his first match of this World Cup against New Zealand and never looked back.
That Shami's excellence was not limited to the cricket field alone made his performance in the World Cup even more noteworthy. When the Indian pacers were making the opposition batters dance to their tunes, brushing aside quality teams like England, Sri Lanka, and South Africa as if they were club teams, Hasan Raza, a former Pakistan cricketer came up with an absurd theory. The former batter said ICC might be giving different balls to the Indian pacers and hence they were able to extract so much movement.
Shami was the only Indian cricketer to take note of that. He shared an Instagram story lambasting the conspiracy theory. Now that the World Cup is over, Shami was once again asked about the incident and the India pacer did not hold back. ""I know I can be bitter while speaking the truth but if I don't open my mouth after all this then it won't be right,"" he said in a podcast with PUMA.
Shami launches scathing attack on ex-Pakistan player's conspiracy theory about India's performance in World Cup
""I'm not jealous of anybody. If you start enjoying the success of others then you can become a better player. I was not playing at the beginning (of the World Cup). Jab khel raha that World Cup, toh 5 wickets liye, 4 wickets aur fir se 5 wickets liye. Kuch Pakistan ke players ko ye baat hajam nahi ho rahi toh main kya karu. Kyuki unke dimaag mein ye hai ki ham best hai. Bhai best woh hota hai jo time per perform kare....aap usme controversy banaya chale ja rahe ho, ki tumhe ball kuch aur colour ki mil rahi hai..kisi aur company ki mil rahi hai....Sudhar jao yaar. (When I started playing, I picked up five wickets then got four and then another five-for. Some Pakistani players couldn't digest it. They think they are the best. The one who performs at the right time is the best. You are creating controversy for no reason. You are saying we are getting different balls, from different companies and all that. Learn your lesson),"" Shami added.
Shami also added that the legendary Wasim Akram explained the process of selecting balls in international cricket but despite that, some former cricketers said all this.
""Wasim Akram had explained how the ball is chosen. How the fourth umpire brings a box to the fielding team but despite that you say all this? It is understandable if you have not played the game at all. But when an ex-player says all these things, I don't think people would do anything else apart from laughing,"" he said.

Padikkal had represented RR in two seasons -- 2022 and 2023 -- and had started his career with the Royal Challengers Bangalore (2019-2021). Avesh had also begun his IPL career at RCB in 2017 before joining Delhi Capitals, where he spent four seasons between 2018-2021. At the mega auction preceding the 2022 edition, he was signed by LSG. Lucknow Super Giants' Avesh Khan celebrates after picking a wicket in the IPL match against Rajasthan Royals(Lucknow Super Giants Twitter)
Avesh has so far played 47 IPL matches and has 55 wickets to his name. The right-arm pacer, who represented LSG in 22 matches & picked 26 wickets after joining the franchise in 2022, was traded to RR for his existing fee (INR 10 crore). Padikkal, meanwhile, will head to LSG from RR for his existing fee (INR 7.75 crore) as well; the left-handed batter has 57 IPL matches under his belt and has scored 1521 runs, smashing a century and 9 fifties.
He represented the RR in 28 matches, scoring 637 runs.
The confirmation of the trade came shortly after Gautam Gambhir, the mentor for LSG, confirmed his departure from the franchise to reunite with Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Gambhir had led the KKR to two IPL titles as captain, and is expected to join the side in a coaching role ahead of the 2024 season.
Padikkal had played in all of RR's matches in the 2022 edition when the side had reached the final of the tournament. However, the Sanju Samson-led team faced a defeat at the hands of tournament's debutants Gujarat Titans in the title clash. Padikkal had scored 376 runs in 17 matches in the edition at a strike rate of 122.88.
Avesh had a strong 2022 season in the tournament as well, picking 18 wickets in 13 matches; his impressive performances ensured him a consistent run in Team India in the shortest format, and Avesh remains a part of the squad for the upcoming T20I series against Australia.

ýýýThis is not 1990s. India wouldýýýve been champions ifýýý': Gautam Gambhir unhappy with Rahul's batting in World Cup final,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's a double-edged sword. But I have always said this, the most courageous team will go on to win the World Cup. I can understand that you need time to build a partnership but 11 to 40 overs is a very, very long time. Someone should have taken that risk,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Gambhir told Sportskeeda.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Either we go for 150 all out or end up with 300ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½: Gambhir
Gambhir admitted that India could have ended up falling for a lesser score had they remained aggressive but they should've tried to score quicker regardless of that. The former opener, who scored 97 in the final of the 2011 World Cup and was instrumental to India's victory in that match, said that getting 240 should have never been an acceptable scenario.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I would have actually liked India going really aggressive with their top 6-7 batters even if they had been all out for 150. I would have been fine. But if you feel you can defend 240 in a World Cup final...that is not where you fight. It is eite go 150 all out or 300. That is where India have lacked. That is where India have not gone on to win ICC tournaments. Rohit should have sent the message before the game that even if I get out we should go aggressive,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
KL Rahul and Virat Kohli put up a fourth-wicket partnership in which they played 109 balls but could score just 67 runs. While Kohli maintained a good strike rate despite the lack of boundaries, it became even more difficult for India to score after he fell on 54 off 63.
Gambhir said that Kohli had been given the role of anchoring the innings and had done it well throughout the tournament. So, other batters should have tried to play aggressively around him. Instead, Rahul ended up scoring just 66 in 107 balls.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Kohli has played a role of anchoring the innings, but the rest all should have been aggressive. KL should have gone. What harm would it have caused? We would have been 150 all out. But had we been brave, we could scored 310 and India would have been world championot the 1990s. 240 is not a good score at all. You need 300-plus totals. India were not brave enough,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Gambhir.

Speaking on his return, Gambhir said he would have a lump in his throat and fire in his heart while wearing the purple and gold jersey again. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I am not an emotional person and not many things move me. But this is different. This is back to where it all started. Today, there is a lump in my throat and fire in my heart as I think about slipping into that purple and gold jersey once again. I am not only coming back to KKR but I am coming back to the city of joy. I am back. I am hungry. I am number 23. Am"" he said.
Welcoming Gambhir back to KKR, co-owner Shah Rukh Khan said - ""Gautam has always been part of the family and this is our Captain coming back home in a different avatar as a ""Mentor"". He was sorely missed and now we all look forward to Chandu Sir and Gautam in instilling the never-say-die spirit and of sportsmanship they stand for, in creating magic with Team KKR.""
Gambhir represented KKR 122 times - the joint second-most along with Yusuf Pathan. He is also the only KKR batter to have scored more than 3000 runs for the franchises. Gambhir amassed 3345 runs at an average of 31 and a strike rate of 124. He was instrumental in building the core of the Kolkata-based franchise. It was under his leadership that KKR roped in Sunil Narine and Andre Russell - two relatively unknown West Indies cricketers at that time who would go on to become the franchise's two most successful overseas recruits.
Narine and Russell continue to be a part of the KKR set-up. The two-time champions, however, did not have the best of seasons last year. They finished seventh in the points table with six wins in eight matches but this year, they will have the get the services of Shreyas Iyer back. Their regular captain was ruled out of the entire last season due to a back injury.

"ýýýIf nothing happened, Shami couldýýýveýýý': Wasim Akram finds flaw in Rohit's 'out of the box thinking' in World Cup final","A fast-scoring World Cup had an anticlimactic finish as Travis Head-inspired Australia crushed a free-scoring India in a low-scoring final. With India suffering another World Cup heartbreak, legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram questioned Rohit Sharma's 'out of the box thinking' after the summit clash of the 50-over spectacle. Ending India's unbeaten run at the One Day International (ODI) World Cup 2023, Pat Cummins' Australia silenced the partisan crowd at the Narendra Modi Stadium with a six-wicket win over the Men In Blue.

After smashing a gigantic total in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand, Rohit's Team India only mustered 240 in the final. Defending the below-par total against the record-time winners, skipper Rohit opted to unleash Mohammed Shami in the second over instead of strike bowler Mohammed Siraj. Though an in-form Shami took the new ball and bagged the all-important wicket of David Warner, the speedster failed to inspire India to a historic win over the Aussies.

'Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs'
Speaking to Sportskeeda about India's approach to attacking the Australian bowlers, Akram opined that Rohit and Co. 'panicked' during the final. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They panicked a bit. I understand that he [Shami] has dismissed many left-handers and has bowled brilliantly from round the wicket. Travis Head survived against him. You must have noted that Shami bowled a couple of wide balls. I feel Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs at the start just because of his swing,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Akram said.
'Out of the box thinking' from Rohit
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Psychologically, Shami knew that he comes first change, so the ball is controllable as it is a little old. Giving him the new ball in the World Cup final, out of the box thinking, I am all for it. But, Siraj should have bowled 2-3 overs at the start. If ami could have been brought on,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Akram added.
Shami bowled seven overs and leaked 47 runs while Siraj recorded identical figures (1 for 45) with the ball as both pacers shared only two wickets in the final. Riding on Head's 137-run off 120 balls, Australia chased down the 240-run target in 43 overs. Head's brilliant century and Marnus Labuschagne's patient knock of 58 propelled Australia to its sixth World Cup crown in Ahmedabad.

'Was Rohit being too greedy? Could he not have curbed himself?': Gavaskar on India captain's wicket in World Cup final,"If there was one turning point in the World Cup 2023 final that put paid to India's chances, it was Rohit Sharma's dismissal. Before his wicket, India were cruising, scoring at almost nine runs an over and had blazed away, as usual, to 76/2 in 9.4 overs. But the moment Rohit was out to that brilliant piece of catching from Travis Head, it was as if the wheels just fell off. From smashing eight fours and three sixes in the first 10 overs, to just four across the next 40, India simply never recovered, and eventually paid the price. Rohit Sharma leaves the field after losing his wicket(AP)
Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has made an interesting point about Rohit's dismissal. The India captain, facing the second over from Glenn Maxwell had already launched him for a six and a four off the previous two balls, making it a 10-run over with three balls to go, and Gavaskar feels he could have done without taking any further risks. The wicket spelled doom and India ended up with just 240, a target which Australia gunned down with Head adding to the home team's woes by blasting a cracking century as the Aussies cantered home by six wickets and 7 overs left.

""Travis Head's superlative turning and running back catch dashed Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s hopes of getting a 300-plus score. That catch dismissed Rohit Sharma, who once again stormed his way to another quickfire 40-plus. That wicket fell in the final over of the first Powerplay where there are only two fielders allowed outside the 30-metre circle. He had already hit a six and a four in the over and was obviously trying to capitalise on the few deliveries left before the Powerplay finished. Was he being too greedy? Could he not have curbed himself since Shubman Gill had already been dism"", Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.

But that's how Rohit has played the entire tournament. The knock of 47 off 31 balls was his fifth dismissal in the 40s, which indicates his role throughout the World Cup has been of an aggressor, an enforcer. That the rest of the Indian batter slowed down is on them, even as Virat Kohli and KL Rahul did their best with half-centuries before eventually shutting shop. Australia read the conditions brilliantly, using the slowness of the surface and squeezing 10 overs between Head, Maxwell and Mitchell Marsh. Had it not been for Rohitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s dismissal, who knowsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ maybe India could have out on a bit more. Another 30 runs, and it could well have made the difference in India's confidence and the outcome ""The fifth bowler's quota for Australia was always a bit of a lottery, and this time, it worked as it not only got the crucial wicket of the Indian captain but also made the other India batters play the non-regular bowlers even more carefully, and thereby lose out on perhaps 30 runs at least. Whether those runs would have made the difference is debatable,"" Gavaskar pointed out.

ýýýAll stats said bat firstýýýýýý: Warner reveals why Australia opted to bowl after winning toss in World final vs India,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½They were discussing it the night before for a good hour and a half or two hours about what to do.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Warner told South Africa great AB de Villiers on the latter's Youtube channel. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½All the stats coming through was saying, bat first and put runs on the board. But for once, when we got all got asked that question, I think a majority of us said let's just chase.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Warner said that the team decided it is better to understand the conditions thoroughly before walking out to bat and the situation would be helped if they did well with the ball. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If we bowl well and understand the conditions like that, we can then chase and then anchor,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
India were all out for 240, with Australia starving them out after they shot off 80 runs in the first 10 overs. While Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami then got the hosts off to a promising start in their defence, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne shut the door with 192-run stand. Head score was unbeaten on 58 off 110 and Australia took the match by six wickets. Warner said that Labuschagne's innings was exactly the kind of thing they hoped they would be able to do if their plan of bowling first paid off.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½What Marnus did was absolutely perfect. You look at when we played India in the first game. I think they were 3/4 (2/3) but then Virat did what he does, KL Rahul as well. They were ice calm. When you know what to get, your best batters generally thrive. They will play the tempo of the game,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Warner, referring to the first match of the tournament between Australia and India. At the time, India had blown Australia away for 199 but were themselves reduced to two runs for the loss of three wickets. However, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul then put up a 165-run stand that ended any chances that the Australians had.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½That was Pat Cummins' best spell of the tournamentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Warner was all praise for Cummins for the way he led the team in the tournament and the way he seeded de Indian batters with his tactics in the final. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He has been so calm the whole time. He was criticised in England for his fielding placements, being defensive and all that. Here as well, he cops it again for the slow start. It's not fair. I get that as a captain he is leading the ship but as a whole unit, we take responsibility ourselves. Yesterday was a testament to that in terms of the way we went about it,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.
Warner also said that Cummins's spell itself was the best he had seen from him in the entire tournament. Cummins recorded figures of 2/34, getting the key wickets of Shreyas Iyer and Kohli. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yesterday was unbelievable the way he bowled. That was his best spell in the entire tournament. The great players stand up when it's time to deliver and yesterday he did that,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Warner.

Suryakumar Yadav looks to shine the light on his talent again,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
The opponents, Australia, will be familiar yet unfamiliar. Many of their ace players have gone back home but they still have seven from their ODI championsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ squad; that includes a certain Travis Head. It is a series that many (players and fans) would have perhaps preferred to sit out but those who have been named, on both sides, have a job to do.
Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s professional sport and poor scheduling for you.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It is difficult,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Yadav ahead of the first T20I. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It will take time. You canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t just get up the next morning and forget everything else. Obviously, we would have loved to win but then, as you say, when you get up next morning, there is sunlight again... light at the end of the tun""
And what does moving on truly mean for Surya? He has been India's breakout star in T20 cricket for a while now but as the World Cup final showed all those watching, ODIs arenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t his cup of tea. On a slowish wicket, he struggled to play with the belligerence we have come to associate with his batting. He got stuck, as did India.
To many this was why India should have perhaps considered Ishan Kishan as an option. The left-hander would have perhaps presented a different problem to the Aussies. At this point though, all those thoughts are little more than the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½what ifsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that accompany every failure.
The numbers have been repeated often enough in the recent past but are worth putting out again: in 37 ODIs, Surya averages 25.8 at a strike-rate of 105 whereas in 53 T20Is, he averages 46.0 at a strike-rate 172.7. The difference is stark and illustrates why he is widely regarded as a side character in ODIs but a bona fide star in T20 cricket.
His endeavour will be to try and take the handbrakese clearly gets. The muddled thinking that plagues him in ODIs miraculously clears up in the shortest format and India and Surya are both the better for it. No one blames anyone for playing shots in T20 cricket and that is what Surya, the skipper, is preaching to his team as well.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Letï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s be very selfless when you go onto the field because I am a guy that doesnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t think too much about personal milestones instead of the teamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s goal,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Surya. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I have always told them you need to keep the teamï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s goal first. I have played a lot of times with them in the IPL and few India games as well. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t that difficult and it is really exciting to get back onto the field.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
The excitement is a mix of real and imagined but with the ICC T20 World Cup scheduled in June 2024, every match still has some value, though one reckons that IPL 2024 will be the real deal breaker.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Keeping the T20 World Cup in mind, games that we play up to them are very i, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½just be fearlessï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. They are in good nick, the team management tells me, and I have told them to enjoy their time in the middle, not do anything different as at the end of the day, this is just another game of cricket.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Just another game of cricket, indeed. Nothing like the previous one he played.

Haris Rauf's PCB contract could be revised after refusing to play Tests in Australia,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
The 'Category A' has only three players including Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Afridi.
A reliable source said that some senior officials in the Pakistan Cricket Board were unhappy at the attitude of Haris and also over the statements made by his Lahore Qalandars coach Aqib Javed, who defended the express pace bowler.
Pakistanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s new chief selector Wahab Riaz hit out at Haris on Monday for first agreeing to be considered for the Tests in Australia before making himself unavailable two days later citing workload and fitness concerns.
Wahab, himself a fast bowler who appeared in three World Cups, made it clear that being a centrally contracted player, Haris should have been available for the Test series.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I and the Director of Pakistan team, Muhammad Hafeez, we went and spoke to him in detail and told him that both the captain and coach wanted him (Haris) to play in Australia as he was an impact bowler and we assured him he would not bowl more then in a day in Australia,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Wahab had said at his press conference while announcing the squad for Australia.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We also spoke to the team physio and trainer and they said Haris had no fitness issues and there would be no problem with him in Australia,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Wahab said.
Hours later sources quoting Haris in the Pakistan media said he had never made himself available for the Tests and had told the selectors he wanted to focus on white ball cricket and manage his workload.
But the source said that the very fact that Haris didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t come out with a denial directly had convinced the senior board officials he was playing games with the board and selectors.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There has been discussion that if Haris is only focussed on white ball cricket then the central contact given to him also needs to be reviewed since he was placed in category B which carries a monthly retainer of over 4 million rupees plus enhanced match fees, bonuses and a share in the PCBï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s share of ICC revenues.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Those were considered all format players,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the source said.
He said it could be expected that the board might either ask Haris for his final decision on red ball cricket and revise his contract and the player also has the option of going freelance and returning the central contract to the board like other international players including Trent Bolt, Jason Roy etc.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A NOC for playing in the Big Bash could also be withheld by the board,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the source added.
The source said that both Hafeez and Wahab had conveyed their disappointment over Haris' attitude to the PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf.
Haris played one Test back in December against England in Rawalpindi where he bowled just 13 overs before getting injured.

India mourning World Cup loss face Aussies again in T20 series,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
A breathing space of at least 10 days would have helped Indian fans who were emotionally invested in the spectacular World Cup run for 45 days only to be left dejected. That only two journalists attended the news conference of Suryakumar Yadav, leading the side, in Vizag on Wednesday suggested a distinct lack of interest.
While most of Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s World Cup squad will take a break, the Australia players are more affected by the packed scheduling. Almost half the players from the winning side, including Travis Head, the batting hero of the final and semi-final, are staying back.
A World Cup win deserves a grand public celebration back home, a once in a lifetime chance to soak in the adulation. But Head admitted he will return to Australia only 12 days after the World Cup victory. Glenn Maxwell, Adam Zampa and Steve Smith are also among those who have stayed back for the T20 series.
This begs the question, when finalising the dates, how could the two cricket boards not onsidered the prospect of their teams going all the way?
Besides Yadav, Ishan Kishan and Prasidh Krishna from the Cup squad will have to lift their energy levels. Ishan played two games and Prasidh none, but they were with the team since the Asia Cup preparatory camp.
NO HEROï¿½ï¿½ï¿½S RETURN FOR HEAD
Save a thought for Head, the player of the final, who will have to refocus on the bilateral series instead of savouring his achievement. Celebrations and farewells are all about timing. It has no value if that moment is lost. You donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t have an open-top bus parade two weeks later, for example.
Head is not as high profile as Smith or Maxwell, and his moments under the sun have been few. Instead of touching down in Australia to a heroï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s welcome, he will return only after the series ends on December 3.
The T20 series has also resulted in a low-key return for the rest of the Australia ODI squad. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We've all split off our own different ways, thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s T20s coming up, some guys are on aeropme as well,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey told reporters on landing in Adelaide. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s probably pretty odd scheduling now that you look at it, to win a World Cup and a few days later youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½re playing again.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
The Australia ODI team next plays only in February, against West Indies. According to reports, Cricket Australia has planned a public celebration when the Test squad assembles in Perth on the December 9-10 weekend for the first Test against Pakistan, though Maxwell, Zampa and Inglis may miss that function too as they will be with their Big Bash League teams.
Ultimately cricket is about commerce, but even from the viewersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ point of view, it amounts to overkill. Former England skipper Michael Vaughan, who was in India as an expert during the World Cup, called the T20 series ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½complete greed and overkillï¿½ï¿½ï¿½.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Why can't we allow players the chance to have a momentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rest after a WC or whoever wins the chance to celebrate properly foed to the India players after their 2011 ODI World Cup victory. They had just a six-day break after Cup final on April 2 before IPL started. It gave MS Dhoniï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s side hardly any time to savour the win. That was at least franchise cricket, but this is national team duty straightaway.
T20 WORLD CUP BUILD-UP
The series will start the build-up to next yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s T20 World Cup in the West Indies and USA. For Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s young players, it will be an opportunity to impress the selectors against a strong Australia.
The focus will on Surya, who gets his favoured platform after the disappointment in the final. He will lead India for the first time. His Mumbai Indians teammate, Ishan Kishan too has the chance to prove he is an effective T20 bat in international cricket after underwhelming efforts in his last few T20I series. In eight games in 2023, he averages 12.13 at a strike rate of 89.81.
Axar Patel, who missed the World Cup due to a quadriceps strain, is back and will be hungry to prove himself as he ndra Jadeja for the spin-bowling all-rounder's spot.
Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rinku Singh, Tilak Varma, Arshdeep Singh and Ravi Bishnoi have done well in the opportunities they have got. They will have to make their chances count against a strong Australia.

While Gill has 826 points, Pakistan batter Babar Azam is second with 824 points and Kohli now has 791 points.
India captain Rohit Sharma, who gave his side an explosive start in almost every outing. also jumped one spot and is now placed fourth with 769 rating points. India now have three batters in the top four of the ODI rankings. Rohit smashed 597 runs and he and Kohli were the two leading run scorers of the tournament.
Gill, who missed a few matches, amassed 354 runs in the showpiece event and Babar scored 320 runs as Pakistan failed to qualify for the semi-final of the tournament.
Meanwhile, South Africa opener Quinton de Kock, who has announced retirement from the format, slipped two spots to fifth, while New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell jumped five spots to sixth. He scored 134(119) against India in the semi-final and amassed 552 runs at the World Cup.
Australia's World Cup winner, Travis Head witnessed a massive climb in his rankings. He jumped 28 spots to 15th overall after his match-winning performance in the summit clash against India.
If we shift our focus to the bowlers, South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj sits at the top, with a slew of Australian players making inroads following their World Cup triumph.
Josh Hazlewood has moved up four places to second overall, while Mitchell Starc moved up eight places to 12th and skipper Pat Cummins moved up seven places to 27th.
Mohammed Siraj (third) and Jasprit Bumrah (fourth) stay in the top ten for ODI bowlers but teammate Kuldeep Yadav dipped one spot to tie sixth.

'Odd scheduling': India series puts dampener on Australia's World Cup celebrations,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
It was a far cry from some of the raucous ticker-tape parades enjoyed by victorious Australian cricket teams of yesteryear. ""We've all split off our own different ways, there's T20s coming up, some guys are on aeroplanes at the moment getting home as well,"" wicketkeeper-batsman Alex Carey told reporters on arrival home in Adelaide.
He added: ""It's probably pretty odd scheduling now that you look at it, to win a World Cup and a few days later you're playing again.""
India have named an almost completely different squad for the series, which starts in Visakhapatnam and then goes to four different venues, concluding in Bengaluru on December 3.
Suryakumar Yadav will captain for the first time, in the absence of Rohit Sharma, and is one of only three players retained from India's World Cup squad.

Former England skipper Michael Vaughan was much less diplomatic than Carey about the prospect of India and Australia meeting again so soon.

After Australia's veteran opener David Warner withdrew from the series on Tuesday, Vaughan wrote on social media: ""As all the players who won the World Cup should.

""They should have been pulled out to allow them time to recover but importantly get back to Oz to enjoy the celebrations.""

Vaughan, who is now a high-profile pundit, was even more forthright last week, calling the series ""complete greed and overkill"".

""Why can't we allow players the chance to have a moment's rest after a WC or whoever wins the chance to celebrate properly for a couple of weeks,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. The World Cup trophy has remained in India and will not be reunited with captain Cummins -- who has this year also guided Australia to win the World Test Championship and retain the Ashes -- until next week, The Age newspaper said.

"Magic moments win tournaments, Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s were all before the","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Early in West Indiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ run chase, Balwinder Singh Sandhu clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a banana inswinger.

A little while later came another moment of magic. Rampaging Viv Richards, threatening to destroy Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s bowling and win the match on his own, hit Madan Lal high between square leg and mid-wicket which Kapil Dev, running behind 20-25 yards keeping his eyes on the ball over his shoulder, converted into a stunning catch.

Richardsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s dismissal for 33 opened up a match that till that point had been one-sided. The West Indies innings lost rhythm, wickets started falling, and overhauling a paltry 183, which looked a cakewalk at the halfway stage, became a mountain too high to climb. India won by 43 runs.

Iï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ve dwelt at some length on the 1983 final because it resonates most strongly in the Indian context. There are several other such examples in World Cup history.

The 1975 final is widely remembered for Clive Lloyd, hitting the ball ng a powerful 102. But the moments of magic came from 23-year-old Viv Richards, in his first year in international cricket, running out three batsmen with his alacrity in the field and pinpoint accuracy of his throws, to scuttle the Aussie run chase.

In the 1992 final, Pakistan were defending a not-so-large score. England looked to be chasing the target serenely till the magical over from Wasim Akram in which he got the set Allan Lamb and dangerous Chris Lewis off successive deliveries to turn the match on its head.

In 2015, Mitchell Starc bowled New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who had been in dazzling form till then, in the first over, and the Kiwis floundered after this body blow.

In 2019, in the semi-final against New Zealand, India were odds-on favourites. But in a match which got extended into the second day because of inclement weather, they suffered a shock defeat chasing a modest target. An incisive opening spell by Trent Boult and Matt Henry saw India lose 3 wickets ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ including Rohitirat ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in a jiffy, and all hopes of reaching the final went kaput.

Sometimes moments of magic for one team coincide with moments of madness for the opposition. In the ODI World Cup 1996 semi-final at Mohali, West Indies were cruising to victory at 165-3 chasing 207, but collapsed sensationally for 202 against Shane Warne.

In the 1999 semi-final between Australia and South Africa, the latter inexplicably stumbled a second time. Herschelle Gibbs first didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t complete a catch of Steve Waugh, allowing him to make a gritty half-century to win the Super Six game. Then, while chasing 213 in the semis, last man Allan Donald was run out in a crazy mix-up with Lance Klusener with the scores tied. Australia went through to the final because they finished higher in the Super Six stage.

In highlighting these incidents, I donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t mean to suggest that knockout matches and finals are won or lost only on moments of magic or madness. In all cases of teams that have won major tournaments in limited overed excellence over a period of time, tenacity and ambition are crucial. However, moments of magic are triggers that can swerve, swing and spin a match away from an anticipated course and lead to an unexpected result.

In Sundayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s final, there was one acutely magical moment. It belonged to Australia when Travis Head ran back 25-30 yards, looked over his shoulder to judge the trajectory of the ball, and dive full-length forward to hold a catch that dismissed Rohit Sharma. Rohit looked in stupendous touch till then and good enough to take the game away from Australia. His dismissal changed the momentum and trend of play, arguably even the result.

Head was not done for the day. In the run chase he tamed Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s vaunted pacers and scored heavily against spinners with strokes of guts and inventiveness to lead his team to a fantastic win. It was a tour de force performance by a player who had only just made it to the tournament at the halfway stage.

In terms of quality of cricket India were undoubtt side in the tournament. Till the final. Thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s where the champion team is decided. India failed this test.

The tenor and texture of Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s campaign reveals the depth and quality of talent in India. In a way. It also creates a template that can make India a more creative and stronger force in limited overs cricket. However, this still doesn't answer whether India can win tournaments consistently.

That, agonisingly, is still to be learnt.

ICC bans transgender players from international women's cricket in major policy decision,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""The new policy is based on the following principles (in order of priority), protection of the integrity of the women's game, safety, fairness and inclusion, and this means any Male to Female participants who have been through any form of male puberty will not be eligible to participate in the international women's game regardless of any surgery or gender reassignment treatment they may have undertaken.""

Gender reassignment and treatment have been a hotly-debated topic in world athletics for years. ICC arrived at the decision at its Board meeting in Ahmedabad on Tuesday. Asked what was the trigger for ICC to bring about this change, a source said it was due to ""cricket's inclusion in the 2028 Olympics.""

""Since cricket will be an Olympic sport, it has to be governed by the Olympic guidelines. This gender issue is a huge one at global level. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has changed regulations and advised sports to implement regulations that are suitable for their sport, which is what we have done,"" said an ICC source.

World Athletic (WA), the governing body for track and field and other running competitions, had also barred transgender women, who went through male puberty, from competing in women's events at international competitions. The policy took effect on 31 March, 2023.

WA also ruled that to compete as a woman, athletes must have a testosterone level below 2.5 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L) for at least 24 months before an international competition.

South African runner Caster Semeneya was barred from competing precisely for this reason as testosterone level in her body were more than the prescribed limit.

World governing bodies for cycling (UCI) and swimming (FINA) had also introduced the same regulation in their sport while World Rugby has an outright ban on trans women in international women's rugby.

The ICC, while firming up rules for gender eligibility for international women's cricket, left the issue at the domestic level in the hands of the member boards.

""The review, which was led by the ICC Medical Advisory Committee chaired by Dr Peter Harcourt, relates solely to gender eligibility for international women's cricket, whilst gender eligibility at domestic level is a matter for each individual Member Board, which may be impacted by local legislation. The regulations will be reviewed within two years,"" said the ICC.

ICC Chief Executive Geoff Allardice said the world governing body had arrived at the decision following ""extensive consultations"".

""The changes to the gender eligibility regulations resulted from an extensive consultation process and is founded in science and aligned with the core principles developed during the review.

""Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women's game and the safety of players,"" said Allardice.

Meanwhile, the Chief Executives' Committee (CEC) endorsed a plan to accelerate the development of women match officials, which includes equal match-day pay for ICC umpires across men's and women's cricket, and ensuring there is one neutral umpire in every ICC Women's Championship series from January next year.

Spectacular as the class of 2023 was, it will be a mere addition to the list of Indian sides that failed to cross the final hurdle.

For Sharma and head coach Rahul Dravid, brought together to win ICC trophies, have steered India through dominant league stage performances in three tournaments. Unfortunately, each time, across three formats in their two years together, the title remains elusive.

Dravid would not have signed up for the job promising trophies. He understands the vagaries of sport too well and philosophises losses even better. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iport. It can happen. The sun will come up tomorrow morning,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said in Ahmedabad on Sunday. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We'll learn from it. Weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ll reflect.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

When he and Sharma, who Dravid said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½gave a lot of his personal time and energy to the campaignï¿½ï¿½ï¿½, sit out to reflect calmly, they will wonder if any of their plans could have been different. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I didn't feel at any stage going into this game that there were any nerves or the guys were intimidated,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Dravid said.

What if Rohit had won the toss and bowled first? Runs on the board though is never a bad ploy in a final. But ow could Cummins and the Aussie think-tank read the foreign pitch so accurately? It seemed Australia knew well considering how they dried up Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s runs in the middle overs and coasted to victory, taming the tournamentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s most successful bowling attack under lights.

There is still no unanimity over what the par score would have been. Rohit said 30-40 more runs would have been good. Cumm. The Aussie skipper might have been just rubbing it in. But could Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s batters have strived to put the Australia bowlers off in the middle overs?

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We lost wickets just when we felt we built a partnership and we can start going,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Dravid. He didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t agree that those partnerships, till the time wickets fell, were too defensive ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ India scored just two boundaries and scored at 3.9 runs per over between overs 11-40. To another question, he said India ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½managed (with five bowlers) pretty well, except for probably this finalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Perhaps, the batting group was worried, not just about the long tail but how productive batters Nos. 6 and 7 would be without the injured Hardik Pandya.

Mohammed Shamiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s around the wicket record against left-handers may have tempted Rohit to hand him the new ball against Travis Head and Dave Warner, but they may, on hindsight, agree with former Aussie skipper Ricky Pontingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s comment that Mohammed Siraj was renderedonal century then stole the match away.

The explosive left-hander had much the same way taken the World Test Championship final away from Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s grasp on Day 1. That was only five months ago when Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pacers, without Jasprit Bumrah, allowed Head safe passage without testing him with short balls, seen as his technical weakness. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There was a debate if we should go short and whether the wet Dukes ball would swing. It was decided that the bowlers should bowl full,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a team member had said after the Oval loss.

Bowling coach Paras Mhambrey had later said it was skipper Rohitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s instinctive call to delay bowling bouncers (Head batted at No.5 and top-scored with 163 off 174 balls). Fine margins, which can prove costly in matches where you see the exit door from the corner of your eye.

Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s widely acknowledged that Indian batters were tame in the T20 World Cup semi-final against England in 2022. Rohitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s decision to go the aggressive route in the powerplays i manner of that defeat at Adelaide. He walked the talk even in the final, scoring at a strike rate of 151. One will never know if the rest of Indiaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s batters could have done more.

'Will Rohit Sharma be playing orï¿½ï¿½ï¿½': Sreesanth picks Team India's squad for next ICC Wor,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

ALSO READ: Suryakumar Yadav to lead India in Australia series, Shreyas Iyer will join squad as vice-captain for last 2 T20Is

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Will Rohit be playing or not is a big questionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Making an early prediction for next year's World Cup, former Indian pacer Shanthakumaran Nair Sreesanth feels the 2007 champions will have either Rohit or Hardik Pandya at the helm. India made it to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup under Rohit's leadersh""Will Rohit Sharma be playing or not is a big question. He'll be captain because he has won all those IPLs. Either Rohit Sharma or Hardik Pandya will be captain depending on the situation, the surroundings,"" Sreesanth told Sportskeeda.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rishabh Pant should be there as third keeperï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

The former India pacer also believes that superstar Rishabh Pant will be fit for selection as the third wicketkeeper at the T20 World Cup. Pant missed major marquee events after suffering multiple injuries in a serious car crash""Rishabh Pant, if he's fit should be there as the third keeper because he might need some time to come back to the setup. We need a match-winner, not someone who just sticks around. We need a player who is ready to play and win matches. That's as of now. He might be the second or first wicketkeeper depending on form,"" Sreesanth added.

Sreesanth picks his India's preliminary squad for T20 World Cup:

Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Hardik Pandya, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Mohammed Shami, Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Siraj.

More than 50 percent of primary schools across many states have enrolment less than 60: NITI Aayog report,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Project enables a system-wide governance transformation in school education. The objective is to ensure that quality is not diluted even when we operate on a larger scale,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the report quoted B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog.
Also Read:
The report analyses the implementation of Project SATH-E in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha under 9 intervention categories namely school consolidation, remedial learning interventions, assessments, teacher recruitment and rationalisation, teacher capacity building, management information systems and academic monitoring systems, governance and accountability, organisation strengthening and leader schools.
The NITI Aayog report pointed out 6 issues that need to be addressed in order to implement a large-scale transformation in providing quality education. That includes:
Addressing the issue of sub-scale, inadequately resourced schools head-on with strong political support
Solving large-scale teacher vacancies issg teacher quality and pedagogy
Enforcing accountability towards learning outcomes
Focus on Early Childhood Education (ECE) and contextualised Mother tongue-based Multilingual Education (MLE)
Strengthening the governance structures in education departments
According to the report, India has 5 times the number of schools than China does for the same enrolment of students. It was also mentioned that more than 50% of primary schools across many states in our country have an enrolment of less than 60 students. NITI Aayog puts forward the idea of merging schools as a plan to mitigate the cost of such sub-scale schools.
School merging was executed in the project and the report presented favourable results from the action plan. The report states that third-party studies in SATH-E have also demonstrated that when executed rigorously the benefits of mergers are largely positive and can lead to improved learning outcomes.
Drawing an example from the project being implemented in Madhya Pradesh, the report stated that 35,000 schools were merged into 16,000 same-campus schools with an aim to improve the quality of education. The merged large schools had adequate teachers and resources and 55 percent of the schools now had a principal when compared to 20 percent before the merger. Similarly, in Jharkhand 4380 schools and in Odisha 2000 small-scale and same-campus schools were merged.
In order to address the issue of the unequal distribution and shortage of teachers in the education sector, the report suggested the need to take up teacher rationalisation and structured policies to be implemented. Aligning with the National Education Policy 2020, NITI Aayog also emphasised the need to priortise Early Childhood Education (ECE) to improve the school readiness of the students.
States have been asked to reconsider the decentralisation of powers to principals, district and block officers by the policy think tank. This step according to the report will give them more financial power and autonomy to take decisions in line with local needs.

Study Abroad: How to prepare for GMAT,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
In an exclusive interview, Sandeep Gupta, Founder of Top One Percent, a global EdTech company that provides effective learning solutions to GMAT & GRE aspirants, talks about the basics of GMAT preparation and how to achieve a 99th percentile score.
How to start the GMAT journey? Is downloading GMATPrep practice tests released by makers of the GMAT the first step?
The ideal way to start your GMAT journey is by starting as soon as possible. Even if you're still in college, taking the GMAT can open a plethora of opportunities for you, from job placements to deferred MBA programs. Many test-takers often begin by downloading the GMATPrep practice tests released by the GMAC, the makers of the GMAT.
While these materials provide a basic understanding of the test format, they may not be sufficient for those aiming for scores above 750. In fact, relying solely on these resources can give students a false sense of security. Instead, consider investing in a professional test preparation service.
Are practice tests the best indicator of how far/near one is from the target?
Practice tests are undoubtedly a valuable tool in your GMAT preparation arsenal, but they shouldn't be viewed as the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bestï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ indicator of your likely score on the actual examination.
It is important to note that test-takers frequently report that the scores from official mock tests are somewhat inflated compared to what one might achieve on the actual GMAT. While this can be encouraging, it can also lull test-takers into a false sense of confidence.
One should use practice tests as a means to evaluate and improve their skill set but remember that continuous refinement and focused preparation are key to achieving the target GMAT score.
Should one first find out what GMAT score one actually needs for the university/course of choice? One needs at least 700 for Top 10 schools, 680 for Top 20, and 650 for Top 50 to pass. Is that a good route for a novice to start?
As a rule of thumb, strive to score 30 to 40  the median score of your target school. Doing so not only strengthens your chances of gaining admission but can also significantly improve your eligibility for scholarships. Considering the high tuition fees associated with MBA programs, securing a scholarship can provide substantial financial relief.

How should one design the study plan - build a toolkit?
I believe those who attempt to create their own study plans without expert guidance often find themselves lost and directionless. That's why my first piece of advice is to consult with a professional test preparation agency.
However, expert guidance alone won't suffice; self-awareness is equally crucial. You need to know your strengths and weaknesses to target your study efforts effectively. One invaluable tool in this regard is maintaining an error log.
Document every question you get wrong, along with the reason for the mistake. Revisit this error logast once a week to review your weak areas and revise your strategies.
Online versus offline study plan? Which one is better?
Choosing between online and offline GMAT study plans depends on individual needs. Online plans offer flexibility and a wealth of resources, often adapting to your performance. Offline plans provide structured learning and immediate feedback from instructors. Many find a hybrid approach most effective, leveraging online resources for flexibility and offline methods for structured learning.
How early should one start? On average, it is said, 3 months (10-15 hours a week) is good enough. Is it?
Although a study period of three months, averaging around three hours per day, is commonly recommended for achieving a competitive score, in my opinion, the earlier you start your GMAT journey, the better. Initiating the process while still in college can open myriad opportunities.
What are the typical GMAT prep mistakes and pitfalls?
One of the most frequent issues is inconsistency in preparation. Irregular study patterns can seriously hinder progress. Another pitfall is relying on easier prep materials, which can provide a false sense of confidence.
Not timing oneself during practice and neglecting certain sections, such as Reading Comprehension, can also be detrimental. Some test-takers overestimate their Quantitative skills and neglect focused practice, which can result in a disappointing performance and lower the overall score.

How does one achieve the 99th percentile? Is it as elusive as numbers convey?
About 0.02% of GMAT test-takers, or about 30 people a year, will score a perfect 800 on the test. Achieving a 99th percentile score on the GMAT is challenging but not insurmountable.
In my 27 years of teaching, many of my students have successfully reached this milestone. The recipe for a top score includes studying high-quality material, benefiting from expert guidance, maintaining consistency, keeping an error log, and practicing under timed conditions.
Is there a time-tested mantra to get a good GMAT score?
If there's a time-tested mantra for achieving a strong GMAT score, it's not to neglect the Quantitative and Reading Comprehension sections. Often, people with engineering backgrounds assume they'll naturally excel in Quantitative, only to find themselves falling short.
Also Read: Logical Reasoning series: Tips to crack and ace exams
Similarly, Reading Comprehension is frequently overlooked, despite being a cornerstone for a great GMAT score. A poor performance in this section can easily lower your overall score by 80-90 points.

The report analyses the implementation of Project SATH-E in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha under 9 intervention categories namely school consolidation, remedial learning interventions, assessments, teacher recruitment and rationalisation, teacher capacity building, management information systems and academic monitoring systems, governance and accountability, organisation strengthening and leader schools.
The NITI Aayog report pointed out 6 issues that need to be addressed in order to implement a large-scale transformation in providing quality education. That includes:
Addressing the issue of sub-scale, inadequately resourced schools head-on with strong political support
Solving large-scale teacher vacancies issg teacher quality and pedagogy
Enforcing accountability towards learning outcomes
Focus on Early Childhood Education (ECE) and contextualised Mother tongue-based Multilingual Education (MLE)
Strengthening the governance structures in education departments
According to the report, India has 5 times the number of schools than China does for the same enrolment of students. It was also mentioned that more than 50% of primary schools across many states in our country have an enrolment of less than 60 students. NITI Aayog puts forward the idea of merging schools as a plan to mitigate the cost of such sub-scale schools.
School merging was executed in the project and the report presented favourable results from the action plan. The report states that third-party studies in SATH-E have also demonstrated that when executed rigorously the benefits of mergers are largely positive and can lead to improved learning outcomes.
Drawing an example from the project being implemented in Madhya Pradesh, the report stated that 35,000 schools were merged into 16,000 same-campus schools with an aim to improve the quality of education. The merged large schools had adequate teachers and resources and 55 percent of the schools now had a principal when compared to 20 percent before the merger. Similarly, in Jharkhand 4380 schools and in Odisha 2000 small-scale and same-campus schools were merged.
In order to address the issue of the unequal distribution and shortage of teachers in the education sector, the report suggested the need to take up teacher rationalisation and structured policies to be implemented. Aligning with the National Education Policy 2020, NITI Aayog also emphasised the need to priortise Early Childhood Education (ECE) to improve the school readiness of the students.
States have been asked to reconsider the decentralisation of powers to principals, district and block officers by the policy think tank. This step according to the report will give them more financial power and autonomy to take decisions in line with local needs.

Study Abroad: How to prepare for GMAT,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
In an exclusive interview, Sandeep Gupta, Founder of Top One Percent, a global EdTech company that provides effective learning solutions to GMAT & GRE aspirants, talks about the basics of GMAT preparation and how to achieve a 99th percentile score.
How to start the GMAT journey? Is downloading GMATPrep practice tests released by makers of the GMAT the first step?
The ideal way to start your GMAT journey is by starting as soon as possible. Even if you're still in college, taking the GMAT can open a plethora of opportunities for you, from job placements to deferred MBA programs. Many test-takers often begin by downloading the GMATPrep practice tests released by the GMAC, the makers of the GMAT.
While these materials provide a basic understanding of the test format, they may not be sufficient for those aiming for scores above 750. In fact, relying solely on these resources can give students a false sense of security. Instead, consider investing in a professional test preparation service.
Are practice tests the best indicator of how far/near one is from the target?
Practice tests are undoubtedly a valuable tool in your GMAT preparation arsenal, but they shouldn't be viewed as the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bestï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ indicator of your likely score on the actual examination.
It is important to note that test-takers frequently report that the scores from official mock tests are somewhat inflated compared to what one might achieve on the actual GMAT. While this can be encouraging, it can also lull test-takers into a false sense of confidence.
One should use practice tests as a means to evaluate and improve their skill set but remember that continuous refinement and focused preparation are key to achieving the target GMAT score.
Should one first find out what GMAT score one actually needs for the university/course of choice? One needs at least 700 for Top 10 schools, 680 for Top 20, and 650 for Top 50 to pass. Is that a good route for a novice to start?
As a rule of thumb, strive to score 30 to 40  the median score of your target school. Doing so not only strengthens your chances of gaining admission but can also significantly improve your eligibility for scholarships. Considering the high tuition fees associated with MBA programs, securing a scholarship can provide substantial financial relief.

How should one design the study plan - build a toolkit?
I believe those who attempt to create their own study plans without expert guidance often find themselves lost and directionless. That's why my first piece of advice is to consult with a professional test preparation agency.
However, expert guidance alone won't suffice; self-awareness is equally crucial. You need to know your strengths and weaknesses to target your study efforts effectively. One invaluable tool in this regard is maintaining an error log.
Document every question you get wrong, along with the reason for the mistake. Revisit this error logast once a week to review your weak areas and revise your strategies.
Online versus offline study plan? Which one is better?
Choosing between online and offline GMAT study plans depends on individual needs. Online plans offer flexibility and a wealth of resources, often adapting to your performance. Offline plans provide structured learning and immediate feedback from instructors. Many find a hybrid approach most effective, leveraging online resources for flexibility and offline methods for structured learning.
How early should one start? On average, it is said, 3 months (10-15 hours a week) is good enough. Is it?
Although a study period of three months, averaging around three hours per day, is commonly recommended for achieving a competitive score, in my opinion, the earlier you start your GMAT journey, the better. Initiating the process while still in college can open myriad opportunities.
What are the typical GMAT prep mistakes and pitfalls?
One of the most frequent issues is inconsistency in preparation. Irregular study patterns can seriously hinder progress. Another pitfall is relying on easier prep materials, which can provide a false sense of confidence.
Not timing oneself during practice and neglecting certain sections, such as Reading Comprehension, can also be detrimental. Some test-takers overestimate their Quantitative skills and neglect focused practice, which can result in a disappointing performance and lower the overall score.

How does one achieve the 99th percentile? Is it as elusive as numbers convey?
About 0.02% of GMAT test-takers, or about 30 people a year, will score a perfect 800 on the test. Achieving a 99th percentile score on the GMAT is challenging but not insurmountable.
In my 27 years of teaching, many of my students have successfully reached this milestone. The recipe for a top score includes studying high-quality material, benefiting from expert guidance, maintaining consistency, keeping an error log, and practicing under timed conditions.
Is there a time-tested mantra to get a good GMAT score?
If there's a time-tested mantra for achieving a strong GMAT score, it's not to neglect the Quantitative and Reading Comprehension sections. Often, people with engineering backgrounds assume they'll naturally excel in Quantitative, only to find themselves falling short.

Children's Day 2023: Choose the ideal preschool programme to fit your child's personality and learning style,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Here are four approaches that can nurture social skills and cognitive development of children as suggested by Bhatia:
The Play Way Method
As Fred Donaldson, the creator of an innovative program called Original Play, states, ""Children learn as they play; most importantly, in play, children learn how to learn."" Similarly, the Play Way method positions children at the core of their learning journey, resembling hands-on learning, where kids explore their surroundings and interact with objects to acquire knowledge.
This approach recognises the innate curiosity of children, encouraging them to discover through fun, creativity, and problem-solving. Moreover, it provides a valuable platform for social development as children learn to share, cooperate, and communicate with their friends.
The Waldorf Method
The Waldorf Method stands as one of the widely embraced approaches to learning, with over 1100 schools in more than 75 countries and more than 2000 early childhood programs spanning six continents adopting this method.
Rooted in the childhood development theory formulated by Rudolf Steiner, the Waldorf Method advocates for learning through artistic and creative means, incorporating elements such as storytelling, music, painting, art, and movement.
A key highlight of this method is its emphasis on allowing children to progress at their own pace, mitigating the stress associated with rigid educational benchmarks. Consequently, individuals who undergo the Waldorf Method are poised to develop into independent thinkers and lifelong learners.
The Montessori Method
Italian physician, educator, and innovator Maria Montessori developed this approach with the core idea of ""letting children learn naturally."" The Montessori Method empowers children to take control of their education through hands-on, self-directed learning.
Providing them with tools and resources enables the exploration of their passions and overcoming challenges. This individualized learning method cultivates essential skills, propelling children toward a future of continuous discovery and learning. Moreover, this approach fosters self-discipline, independence, and positive self-esteem in children.
Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in the Finnish Education System
Finland's education system is globally acclaimed as one of the best. Preschool education in Finland is rooted in the belief that childhood is a precious period of life, and they regard children as individuals and whole persons.
The Finnish Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) program is renowned for emphasising play, social interaction, and individualised learning. Moreover, the Finnish system customises learning for each child, focusing on their unique interests and strengths. This approach establishes a positive learning environment that encourages children to explore, discover, and learn at their own pace.

IIT Madras researchers develop app with zero commission fee for inter-city goods transportation,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
The OptRoute mobile application has two user modes, one for the driver and the other for the customer who can place a request for the goods transport. This app connects a driver with the customer by accepting the requests through the app. No commission or onboarding fee for the ride would be taken. Thus, the payment for the ride from the customer goes directly to the driver, with no intermediaries, said IIT Madras in the official press release.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½OptRoute aims to solve the issues in connectivity between drivers and customers in the goods logistics and transport domain. The main issues faced are the unavailability of return load for transporters and vehicle capacity under-utilization. The current market of this domain is highly unorganized making it inefficient. It is also ripe for the deployment of technology-based solutions to reach the goals set by the National Logistics Policy, 2022,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Prof Narayanaswamy, Department of Computer Science and Engineerins.
There are differences between OptRoute and the existing services, like the zero commission on every transaction made by the driver and the customer, the nominal subscription-based service model and no intermediaries between them as the driver gets paid directly. Additionally, there won't be separate apps- just a single app for both the driver and customer which is available on Android phones and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have developed a lightweight mobile application where customers and drivers can get connected. OptRoute does not use any third-party services allowing us to cut down the cost of operation to an absolute minimum and because of the same reason we are able to provide our service with zero percent commission. This design and development has had a significant contribution done by alumni and students of IIT Madras. By the end of this year, we will scale our service to be available in 500+ cities,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Anuj Fulia, Co-founder, OptRoute Logistics, and an IITnus.
The basic idea was presented during the 2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference held in Cancun, Mexico. Currently the mobile application is available for operational use in multiple cities across the country, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Noida, Panchkula, Pune, Mohali, Surat and Zirakpur, informed IIT Madras.

IIT Roorkee research team develops a one-step separation of milk fat globules based on size,"Due to the ability to selectively separate and focus on the bioactive components of milk, milk microfiltration has gained much attention in the dairy industry. A study conducted by a research team at IIT Roorkee demonstrated the one-step separation of fat globules based on size from bovine milk using a cross-flow microfiltration. Microfiltration unit separating globules from milk based on their size(Handout)

According to a press release by IIT Roorkee, the first author of the research, PhD student Ayushi Kapoor, was granted the International Travel Award by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. Her research paper has been selected for oral presentation at the upcoming Annual Conference of the Membrane Society Australasia conference in Perth, Australia in December. The study was recently published in the Separation and Purification Technology journal, and the institute has filed a complete Indian patent for the process.

Further application of milk microfiltration can be seen in food fortification. One such compound is the milk fat globules, a bioactive component that has potential health benefits, which undergo structural and functional damage, membrane phospholipids loss, experience longer processing time, and higher recovery cost due to its current multi-step separation process. The research team developed a one-step process to segregate the smaller milk fat globules from bovine milk with respect to their size, thus preserving their structural and nutritional qualities, mentioned the media release by IIT Roorkee.

5 common mistakes students preparing for competitive exams should avoid,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Many students experience stress and anxiety when they hear the words ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½competitive examsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½. Students are under immense pressure to perform well as they believe that these tests will pave the way for their ideal careers. They need focused preparation, suitable study material, and a myriad of other skills to make it to the top ranks in the exam.

But before their preparation gets underway, they must first be aware of the most common mistakes that can derail their exam aspirations. Avoiding these mistakes wonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t just make the preparation streamlined but also reduce the pressure, stress, and unnecessary tension weighing on their minds.

Here's a look at some common mistakes that students should steer clear of:

Failing to set a realistic score

Setting a realistic target score has a two-pronged advantage. First, it helps you identify topics that you can skip over. This will leave you with more time and energy to solidify the topics you choose to study.

ke off the pressure to perform. While it is great to aspire to top the exam, not everyone has the time or space to do so. Instead, look for an ideal range of scores that will help you reach your target college.

For instance, those aspiring for an NMIMS MBA can set a target score of 250 to clear the cutoffs instead of chasing the elusive 290+. Those looking to get into great UG courses abroad can aim for a 1400+ score on their SATs. Realistic targets based on an innate understanding of your own capabilities, time, and resources are a great way to start your prep on a positive note.

Neglecting Mock Tests

A wonderful method to assess your subject-matter understanding is through mock tests. Most high scorers take as many mock tests as possible to gain experience with actual exams.

Taking mock tests helps you not only become familiarised with the format of the exam but also evaluate your performance under stress. It will highlight your areas of weakness so that you can strengthen them.

Taking mock tests can assist you in becoming more adept at managing your time. It helps you to craft your test-taking strategy, especially when it is a speed test. As the exam date approaches, shift your focus to taking as many mocks as possible.

Leaving Your Errors Unreviewed

Make sure you carefully evaluate your performance after taking a mock test to identify your weak points. If you keep making the same mistakes, there is no benefit in practicing for mock exams. A targeted approach to address areas where you lack confidence is a wise way to boost your performance.

Focus on strengthening these areas through practice. To keep your learning curve expanding, track your development over time and evaluate your performance on succeeding mock tests.

Poor Time Management

Time management abilities are not only necessary during the planning phase but also when you are seated in the exam room writing your paper. Once you become accustomed to the exam format, schedule your mock tests.

Compare the amount of time you spend on each question to the recommended amount of time for each section. This will assist you in effectively managing your time, which is a productive strategy that will undoubtedly boost your sense of confidence.

Refusing to Revise

Most students begin studying for exams at the last moment, leaving little time for revision and mock tests. It's critical to comprehend the importance of revision.

You review concepts when you revise, which improves your ability to remember them during crucial moments. Revision strengthens your memory's ability to retain essential information, which will help you work even harder to reach your objectives.

One way to review and get ready for an exam is through mock tests. To ensure that you have enough time to review before taking the exams, make sure to arrange your schedule backwards.

Strategic Preparation for Competitive Exams!

It takes more than just effort to succeed in competitive exams. It is essential to steer clear of issues, including having unrealistic expectations for scores, skipping mock tests, not reviewing mistakes, managing your time poorly, and not revising your work.

One can significantly increase their chances of cracking these demanding exams by creating a well-organised study strategy incorporating these components. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s advised to read about the strategies used by toppers and expert mentors so that you can adopt the best practices for yourself and avoid wasting too much time reinventing the wheel.

Moreover, a thorough review of topics like percentage, profit and loss, data interpretation, and simplification helps one to establish a robust foundation in mathematical principles. Allocating time for current affairs, banking awareness, and financial concepts is important.

Revise all the formulas:

Due to the plethora of technical information and mathematically focused topics, revising formulas pertaining to percentage calculations, profit and loss determinations, data interpretation methodologies, simplification principles, quadratic equations, time and work computations, etc. becomes important.

Learning new concepts would be confusing, hence maintaining a formulas sheet and going over that repeatedly would be beneficial.

Practice with Mock Tests:

Engage in intensive practice sessions with mock tests and previous years' question papers to familiarise with the exam pattern, time management, and question difficulty level.

Candidates can develop a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses in different subject areas, enabling them to allocate their study time more efficiently and focus on areas that need the most attention.

Analysing performance in mock tests aids in the identification of recurring mistakes and helps you with a more focused approach to revision. Mock tests also help in acclimatising candidates to the pressure and stress associated with the actual exam, which can be helpful in stress and time management.

Stay Updated with Current Affairs:

Stay updated on recent developments in the fields of banking, finance, and general awareness by consistently reading newspapers, magazines, and reliable online sources.

Pay special attention to significant economic and financial events and their implications for the banking sector. A strong grasp of current affairs fosters critical thinking and analytical skills, enabling candidates to contextualise complex financial concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. It also demonstrates a proactive approach to learning and an in-depth understanding of the interconnection between global events and the financial markets.

Stress Management and Relaxation:

Prioritising mental and emotional well-being by incorporating stress management and relaxation techniques is integral in exam preparation.

Engaging in activities such as meditation, deep breathing exercises, and light physical exercises helps alleviate exam-related stress and anxiety. A sound mind is important to answer this highly intensive exam, and stress management techniques are an integral way of supervising oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s well-being to ensure their physical and mental fitness to tackle the exam effectively.

These strategies ensure a holistic preparation approach for the IBPS PO examination and become helpful to candidates in pursuing their future endeavors in the BFSI sector.

This could involve understanding the unique challenges of designing for headsets, including issues around user experience, motion sickness and eye strain.

Understanding Spatial Design

Designing in 3D space is different from designing for a flat screen. Designers will need to understand how to guide users through a 3D space, how to make use of different levels and depths, and how to create an engaging environment that encourages exploration. Devices like Apple Vision Pro will require understanding spatial design with new OS, platforms, frameworks and tools.

Familiarity with AI and Machine Learning

AI is going to play a very significant role in the metaverse, from creating non-player characters (NPCs) that can interact with users, to using machine learning algorithms to personalize user experiences. Designers should have a basic understanding of these technologies and how they can be utilized in a metaverse context.

Awareness of Ethical Design Principles

As with any technology, there are numerous ethical considerations when designing for the metaverse. These could include issues around data privacy, accessibility, and the potential for addiction. A good designer will be aware of these issues and incorporate solutions into their designs.

Design students can position themselves at the forefront of this exciting new field of spatial computing and the Metaverse by upskilling themselves in the above areas using numerous short courses that will let them gain these specific skills as a complement to their existing design education.

As technology is developing rapidly and best practices are likely to change and evolve, the design student needs to be aware that continuous learning and adaptability will be key to success in the coming decade.

Predictive analytics plays a role in making informed investment decisions and effectively managing risks.

While acknowledging the growing digitization of finance, it's important to address the accompanying challenges and risks that demand attention:

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ With financial institutions becoming increasingly digital, they become more susceptible to cyberattacks. Hence, protecting sensitive customer data and financial assets becomes essential.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Balancing compliance and innovation can be a challenge for organizations since digital technologies tend to move faster than regulatory rules.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Replacing conventional and legacy systems with digital technologies can be costly and complex. A smooth t becomes necessary to minimize this disruption.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Building and maintaining customer trust in the digital age is a critical aspect. Therefore, transparency when it comes to data handling, robust privacy policies, and responsive customer support are essential to retain customers.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Any digital transformation requires a skilled workforce and an openness to shift towards and adapt to change.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The collection and use of customer data give rise to privacy concerns. It becomes essential to balance the benefits of data-driven insights with ethical and legal aspects.

To address these challenges, financial firms need to begin with a strong strategy that complements their business objectives and customer needs. Investing in talent and hiring or upgrading employeesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ skills with digital knowledge will ensure a smooth transition to digital systems.

It is important to start small with pilot projects to test new technologies and processes before scaling up. Another critical step is to estnance policies to ensure data accuracy, security and compliance.

Collaboration and continuous innovation, especially by partnering with FinTech firms, can help promote a culture of ongoing innovation within the organization.

Lastly, by employing digital technologies, firms can focus on improving customer experience through personalized services and responsive support, taking a customer-centric approach.

Can over-exercising lead to heart attacks? Key tips to keep your heart safe,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
He cautioned, ""Primary concerns with overexercising is the strain it places on the heart. During strenuous physical activity, the heart pumps more blood to supply oxygen and nutrients to the muscles. This is a normal response to exercise, and it helps improve the heart's efficiency. However, when exercise is taken to the extreme, the heart can become overworked and fatigued, increasing the risk of adverse cardiac events. One common condition associated with overexercising is known as ""athlete's heart"" or ""exercise-induced cardiac remodeling."" In individuals who consistently push their bodies to the limits, the heart undergoes structural changes to accommodate the increased demand for blood flow. While these adaptations are generally benign in well-trained athletes, they can be problematic for those who over exercise without proper guidance or recovery.""
Dr Abhijit Borse pointed out the potential risks of overexercising as -
Increased Heart Rate: Over-exercising can lead to a persistent elevated heart rate, which, over time, may weaken the heart muscle and reduce its ability to pump effectively.

Why did the Pilgrims celebrate the first Thanksgiving? Know the complete story,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
European settlers, carrying diseases that devastated indigenous populations, made it easier for colonisers to seize lands while instances of warfare, massacres and forced displacement further tainted the relations between settlers and Native Americans. Hence, the Thanksgiving feast, although a diplomatic interaction, is still controversial as some do not consider it as a tradition of warmth and harmony but rather an alliance prompted by mutual defense concerns while the holiday remains contentious due to its historical inaccuracies, cultural appropriation and painful associations for indigenous communities.
The conventional story of Thanksgiving, often taught in schools, has it that the Wampanoag, particularly Squanto who had learned English after being captured and taken to Europe, played a crucial role in helping the Pilgrims adapt to their new environment by returning to his homeland and serving as an interpreter and guide for the settlers. He taught the Pilgrims essential skills, such as planting corn, using fish as fertiliser and hunting leading to a successful harvest for the Pilgrims in the fall of 1621.
To celebrate their newfound prosperity and express gratitude for the help received from the Wampanoag, Pilgrims organised a three-day feast and this event is now commonly referred to as the first Thanksgiving where the celebration included feasting on deer, fowl and fish, as well as native fruits and vegetables since it was a communal event that brought together the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag, fostering goodwill and cooperation between the two groups.
The first Thanksgiving is often seen as a symbol of the spirit of gratitude and cooperation between different cultural groups but while it wasn't an annual tradition at that time, the idea of Thanksgiving as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a time to give thanks for a good harvest and the blessings of the past yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ eventually evolved into the American Thanksgiving holiday celebrated on the fourth Thursday of November. It wasnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t  the American civil war, that President Abraham Lincoln declared a national Thanksgiving Day that was to be held each November and the holiday was annually proclaimed by every President thereafter.
However, after a joint resolution of Congress in 1941, President Franklin D Roosevelt issued a proclamation in 1942, designating the fourth Thursday in November (which is not always the last Thursday) as Thanksgiving Day. Today, Thanksgiving is celebrated to say thanks and recognise the sacrifices and blessings of the past year as with more urbanisation, Thanksgiving became a day for people to get together with their friends and family to celebrate the day with a scrumptious feast.
The holiday moved away from its cultural roots to allow immigrants of every background to participate in a common tradition.

When is Black Friday in 2023?
Black Friday falls a day after the festival of Thanksgiving, the traditional US holiday where people gather to express gratitude over a delicious meal with traditional delicacies like roast turkey apart from other dishes. Unlike earlier years, the advent of online shopping has also allowed people to shop from their comforts of home on Black Friday for a hassle-free shopping experience. This year Thanksgiving is being celebrated on November 23, 2023, while Black Friday falls on November 24, 2023.
The preparation for Christmas starts a month in advance with Black Friday as people inaugurate the shopping season availing massive discounts offered by retailers, both in physical stores and online.
Origin of Black Friday
The term Black Friday originated way back in the 1960s and early 1970s in Philadelphia when the festive vibe of Thanksgiving spilled over to the weekends with people shopping for Christmas and eating out with their family and friends which resulted in chaos on the streets making it difficult for policemen and bus drivers to handle the crowd, and cases of shoplifting and parking violations also happened. No wonder, they coined the term 'Black Friday' to describe their never-ending shifts.
While Black Friday was re-branded Big Friday for some time by department stores eager to make it sound positive, the retailers preferred the term Black Friday as the day when their ledgers were 'in the black' or in profit and 'not in the red' or in loss.",LifeStyle
Delhi to restrict entry of buses on these norms from other states if GRAP Stage IV invoked,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
""Entry of all buses, including All India Tourist buses/ Contract Carriage buses/ State Transport Buses or holding any other kind of permit into Delhi from other states except CNG / Electric or BSVI diesel buses will be restricted as and when GRAP IV invokes.
""The above mentioned restrictions shall stand automatically applicable, as and when GRAP - IV is invoked from the date of issuance of this order in Delhi Gazette, and if the GRAP IV is revoked the said restrictions stand terminated automatically, no separate order will be issued,"" an official gazette notification said.
Last month, the Delhi government directed that all buses entering the national capital from Haryana will have to be run on electricity, CNG or BS-VI diesel.
Buses entering from the NCR regions of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan also need to follow these norms.
The city government's transport department said all buses entering Delhi from any city or town in Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh from July 1 will only be those that run on electricity, CNG and BS-VI diesel.
The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area, a statutory body responsible for formulating strategies to combat pollution in the region, had on November 18 asked Delhi and NCR states to revoke all emergency measures, under which only CNG, electric and BS VI-compliant vehicles from other states are allowed to enter Delhi, with exemptions granted to those involved in essential services.
The air quality across the city worsened on Wednesday morning and was recorded in the very poor category.
The city's Air Quality Index stood at 394 at 9.05 am on Wednesday, up from 365 on Tuesday.
The GRAP for the NCR has been classified under four different stages of adverse air quality in Delhi viz. Stage ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I 'poor' (AQI 201 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ 300), Stage ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ II 'very poor (AQI 301-400), Stage ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ III 'severe' (AQI 401-450) and Stage ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ IV 'severe ' (AQI >450), respectively.

Meghalaya plans small museum at old Assembly building for heritage tourism,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Shillong, which was the capital of undivided Assam, is nicknamed the 'Scotland of the East' and is known for its historical importance and pristine natural beauty
The three-day Mart seeks to focus on the tourism potential of the northeast, particularly Meghalaya which is the host state.
""I think a generic policy to ensure that these kinds of heritage sites are promoted from a tourist aspect, is definitely part of the overall strategy,"" he said.
""What is important is that we are bringing in different stakeholders together and really trying to discuss and connect different dots together out here. So, that is the purpose of today's programme,"" he said.
""The Legislative Assembly building site (in Shillong)... you are aware that the Assembly (building) got burnt almost about 20 years back. And therefore not much left of it. But we have not touched it, and left it as it is because we had to do some of the assembly work there,"" he said during a press interaction.
""But as soon as we shift to the new assembly site whose construction is going on... By September 2024, we expect to inaugurate it,"" he said.
Sangma said the old building, a British-era structure, was used in undivided Assam and has a lot of history, he added.
""Definitely we have a plan along with the Speaker to have a small museum or some kind of a site there where we could have some section of the area ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ maybe not the whole"" Sangma said.
Raj Bhavan building and Rabindranath Tagoreï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s house also have heritage value, the chief minister said, adding that there are many such sites.
Asked about the state's strategy to balance tourism-related development and environment protection, he said the state has been focussing on sustainable tourism and ecotourism.
The government is also ensuring that it creates policies that do not put enormous pressure on certain tourist sites, Sangma said.

5 tips to follow to manage endometriosis,"Endometriosis is a health condition characterised by the growth of tissue resembling the uterine lining outside the uterus, resulting in intense pelvic pain and fertility problems hence, the one with endometriosis should stick to the foolproof measures given by the expert. Endometriosis wreaks havoc on oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s overall well-being, affecting not only your body but also your emotions and mental state. 5 tips to follow to manage endometriosis (Shutterstock)
In an interview with HT Lifestyle, Dr Madhulika Singh, Consultant Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Ankura Hospital in Pune, shared, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Each day presents a fresh set of obstacles, from agonising pelvic pain to unwelcome weight gain, the irregular menstrual cycle and troublesome bowel issues. The symptoms of this condition are such as excessive menstrual cramps, abnormal or heavy menstrual flow and pain during intercourse, painful bowel movements and/or urination, chronic pelvic pain, abdominal bloating, nausea, fatigue, and infertility. It is crucial tth your doctor before attempting any home remedies for endometriosis.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
If you or someone you know is grappling with this condition and searching for effective strategies to alleviate its symptoms then follow these tips suggested by Dr Madhulika Singh to manage endometriosis:
Eat fruits and vegetables to maintain overall well-being. They contain higher levels of essential nutrients and fiber that promote feelings of fullness for longer periods compared to refined carbohydrates and fatty foods. Also, have omega-3 fatty acids which not only reduce the risk of endometriosis but also improve brain function and emotional well-being. Maintaining adequate water intake is a crucial practice with numerous advantages for your health. By staying properly hydrated, you can lower the likelihood of experiencing bloating, a frequent consequence of endometriosis. Additionally, sufficient hydration can alleviate cramps and enhance your overall well-being. So, drink enough water every day. Stick to a regular exercise roto reduce pain and improve overall health. Weight management is another crucial aspect of exercise as obesity can negatively impact hormonal health. Losing weight can alleviate pain and symptoms for many women. Furthermore, exercise directly impacts hormone production by reducing estrogen levels and stimulating the release of endorphins. Since estrogen contributes to the development of endometriosis, engaging in regular exercise may potentially slow down or halt the progression of this condition. Make getting a good night's sleep your top priority. Many women with endometriosis struggle to achieve a peaceful night's rest. Lack of sleep among women with endometriosis resulted in heightened levels of depression, bladder pain, and an overall decline in their quality of life. Get a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per day. The pain extends beyond the physical realm, taking an emotional toll as well. To alleviate this burden, calm the mind through practices such as meditation and deep breathing. Meditation can effectively alleviate symptoms of chronic pain and depression in women with endometriosis.
Dr Madhulika Singh concluded, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Living with endometriosis can be a constant battle, both physically and emotionally. It often feels like a secret struggle, with the pain and symptoms hidden behind closed doors. Endometriosis not only affects physical health but also disrupts relationships, careers, and personal goals. Recognizing these emotional impacts is essential in supporting those affected by endometriosis holistically. Mental health support should accompany medical treatments. Understanding that living with endometriosis goes beyond just physical pain, it is necessary to create a supportive environment for those impacted by this condition. If you or your loved one is having endometriosis then it is essential to adhere to a well-balanced lifestyle to control symptoms of endometrios",LifeStyle
How bacteria in the stomach ease constipation: Study,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
""We established the causal link between a genetic variant--the abfA cluster--to the key functional difference of probiotic B. longum in multiple model organisms, including mice and humans, and provided mechanistic and ecological insights into how a single gene cluster can affect the gut motility of hosts through arabinan metabolism,"" said Qixiao Zhai of Jiangnan University, one of the paper's co-senior authors.

Impaired gastrointestinal motility has been implicated in gut microbial dysbiosis, which is characterized by a significant decrease in the abundance of beneficial microorganisms, some of which are conventionally known as probiotics. Orally administrated probiotics have therefore been widely used to alleviate symptoms.
Yet the therapeutic effect of probiotics for constipation often varies substantially across strains within the same species. Due to elusive mechanisms, the rational choice of probiotics remains challenging for medical care professionals and patients. In addition, most evidence on the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut motility mainly emerged from studies using a mouse model.
""Probiotic strains were often effective in animal models yet failed in human clinical trials or were poorly validated in humans,"" said Jiachao Zhang of Hainan University, the study's second co-senior author.
""Proof-of-concept studies based on a human cohort in combination with evidence from animal studies are urgently needed for translational research.""
Zhai, Zhang, and Shi Huang of the University of Hong Kong, the paper's third co-senior author, set out to identify and systematically validate the key genetic factors of exogenous probiotics or resident gut microbiota affecting gastrointestinal motility. They isolated 185 B. longum strains from 354 Chinese subjects who ranged in age from 0 to 108 years.
From a comprehensive library of wild B. longum strains, they discovered that the effective alleviation of constipation in mice is regulated by the abfA cluster. This key genetic factor preferentially enhances the utilization of arabinan--a common constituent of plant polysaccharides, an indigestible fibre for humans, and a poorly accessible source of nutrients for normal gut microbes.
The researchers further validated the abfA cluster's functional roles using gene-knockout experiments. In mice with constipation, B. longum, but not an abfA mutant, improved gastrointestinal transit time--an effect that was dependent upon dietary arabinan.
To establish its functional roles for ameliorating constipation in humans, the researchers used a clinical trial and a human-to-mouse faecal microbiota transplantation experiment in combination with metagenomics and metabolomics.
In the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, supplementation with abfA-cluster-carrying B. longum, but not an abfA-deficient strain, enriched arabinan-utilization residents, increased beneficial metabolites, and improved constipation symptoms.
Across human cohorts, abfA-cluster abundance in the faecal microbiomes predicted constipation and transplantation of abfA cluster-enriched human microbiota to mice with constipation improved gut motility.
Notably, other than B. longum, the abfA gene/cluster is prevalent in gut residents, regulating symptoms in both mice and humans.
The authors say that the abfA cluster is a gut-microbiome therapeutic target for constipation in humans. More broadly, the results suggest that genetic factors governing the unique metabolic capability of probiotics should be primarily considered for screening probiotics or inferring their treatment efficacy for gastrointestinal diseases.
""Collectively, this study identified and systematically characterized a key genetic factor responsible for arabinan utilization that addressed one critical challenge in the probiotic field, namely widespread yet unknown strain specificity in probiotic treatment efficacy,"" Huang said.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our proof-of-concept study also established generalizable principles for the rational development of colonizable, functional probiotics with persistent treatment efficacy in multiple model organisms. Moreover, the abfA cluster is so prevalent in the gut microbiota that it can be developed as a simple yet powerful biomarker for gastrointestinal diseases.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Coffee grounds can help prevent neurological disorders: Study,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
A team led by Jyotish Kumar, a doctoral student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, and overseen by Mahesh Narayan, PhD, a professor and Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry in the same department, discovered that caffeic-acid-based Carbon Quantum Dots (CACQDs), which can be derived from spent coffee grounds, have the potential to protect brain cells from the damage caused by several neurodegenerative diseases.
ALSO READ: Coffee may not be helpful in improving mobility in people with Parkinsonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s
We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join
Their findings are detailed in a report published in Environmental Rese""Caffeic-acid based Carbon Quantum Dots have the potential to be transformative in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders,"" Kumar said. ""This is because none of the current treatments resolve the diseases; they only help manage the symptoms. Our aim is to find a cure by addressing the atomic and molecular underpinnings that drive these conditions.""
Neurodegenerative diseases are primarily characterized by the loss of neurons or brain cells. They inhibit a person's ability to perform basic functions such as movement and speech, as well as more complicated tasks including bladder and bowel functions, and cognitive abilities.
The disorders, when they are in their early stages and are caused by lifestyle or environmental factors, share several traits. These include elevated levels of free radicals -- harmful molecules that are known to contribute to other diseases such as cancer, heart disease and vision loss -- in the brain, and the aggregation of fragments of amyloid-forming proteins that can lead to plaques or fibrils in the brain.
Kumar and his colleagues found that CACQDs were neuroprotective across test tube experiments, cell lines and other models of Parkinson's disease when the disorder was caused by a pesticide called paraquat. The CACQDs, the team observed, were able to remove free radicals or prevent them from causing damage and inhibited the aggregation of amyloid protein fragments without causing any significant side effects.
The team hypothesizes that in humans, in the very early stage of a condition such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, a treatment based on CACQDs can be effective in preventing full-on disease.
""It is critical to address these disorders before they reach the clinical stage,"" Narayan said. ""At that point, it is likely too late. Any current treatments that can address advanced symptoms of neurodegenerative disease are simply beyond the means of most people. Our aim is to come up with a solution that can prevent most cases of these conditions at a cost that is manageable for as many patients as possible.""
Caffeic acid belongs to a family of compounds called polyphenols, which are plant-based compounds known for their antioxidant, or free radical-scavenging properties. Caffeic acid is unique because it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and is thus able to exert its effects upon the cells inside the brain, Narayan said.
The process the team uses to extract CACQDs from used coffee grounds is considered ""green chemistry,"" which means it is environmentally friendly. In their lab, the team ""cooks"" samples of coffee grounds at 200 degrees for four hours to reorient the caffeic acid's carbon structure and form CACQDs. The sheer abundance of coffee grounds is what makes the process both economical and sustainable, Narayan said. (ANI)

What is a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½dopamine detoxï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and how can it improve your mental health? Know from mental he,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Experts say that by limiting these external stimuli and letting us get bored or dissatisfied, we can control these unnatural urges to indulge in pleasure and replace them with healthy habits that are likely to make us more satisfied and happier in longer run.
""Our age of constant digital connection often overtaxes the brainï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s pleasure pathways. Science indicates that activities like gaming and social media can spur harmful surges of dopamine, the neurotransmitter governing desire. This fuels shorter attention spans, impulsive behaviours, and even depression as we grow desensitized. A 'dopamine fast' offers respite by strategically limiting stimuli that drive compulsive dopamine-seeking. Taking a break from quick 'hits' of digital affirmation asks us to dive inward instead. By temporarily minimizing designated activities like causal web surfing or sugary snacks, we create space for reflection. The resulting boredom or dissatisfaction, while initially uncomfortable, can uncover deeper needs driving surface behav"" says Dr Chandni Tugnait, M.D. (Alternative Medicines), Psychotherapist, Life Coach, Business Coach, NLP Expert, Healer, Founder & Director - Gateway of Healing.
""Emerging research suggests that short-term absence in fact heightens sensitivity to more meaningful rewards, like close connections, intellectual challenges, and sensorial pleasures. With more intentional living, dopamine returns to more balanced functioning. By recalibrating the reward system, dopamine fasts renew appreciation for simpler joys untouched by keyboards. Our relationships, attention spans, and sense of fulfilment stand to benefit from such digital sabbaticals,"" adds Dr Chandni.
What is a dopamine detox?
""A dopamine detox, often referred to as a 'dopamine fast', is a concept that has gained popularity in recent years as a way to reset the brain's reward system and break free from excessive stimulation. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure, reward, and motivation, and it plays a crucial role in our brain's reward pathway,"" says Dr Jyoti Kapoor, Founder-Director and Senior Psychiatrist, Manasthali.
How dopamine detox can help
Dr Chandni shares ways taking a break from screens and other such distraction can help:
Reduces overstimulation: Constant stimulation can lead to a desensitization of dopamine receptors, making it harder to find joy in simple, everyday activities. A dopamine detox can help reset these receptors.
Increases focus and productivity: By removing distractions and activities that offer instant gratification, a dopamine detox can help improve overall productivity, allowing for deeper engagement in meaningful tasks.
Promotes mindfulness: It encourages you to engage in activities that might not provide immediate pleasure but are fulfilling and enriching in the long run, such as meditation, reading, or spending time in nature.

Improves self-control and discipline: By consciously abstaining from certain activities, you can develop greater self-control and discipline, which are key aspects of emotional regulation and mental resilience.

Encourages healthier habits: It can lead to the adoption of healthier habits, as you might replace high-dopamine activities with those that are more beneficial for your mental and physical health. Some of these could revolve around immersing in nature, creative arts or building connections.

Enhances emotional stability: A detox can reduce the emotional highs and lows associated with dopamine spikes and crashes, leading to a more stable mood.

Improves quality of relationships: By reducing the time spent on digital devices, you may find more time and energy to invest in face-to-face interactions and build deeper, more meaningful relationships.

Dr Jyoti Kapoor adds more benefits of dopamine detox to the list saying it can improve mood and provides one opportunity to reflect and rejuvenate, giving a break from overstimulation.

Increased sensitivity to pleasure: By temporarily abstaining from highly stimulating activities, the brain's dopamine receptors may become more sensitive to natural, everyday pleasures. This heightened sensitivity could lead to a greater appreciation for simpler activities and a more balanced reward system.

Reduced dependence on instant gratification: Engaging in activities that provide instant gratification, such as social media scrolling or video gaming, can create a cycle of dependency. A dopamine detox aims to break this cycle, encouraging individuals to find satisfaction in activities that require patience, effort, and delayed rewards. Over time, this shift may lead to a reduced reliance on immediate sources of pleasure.

Improved mood regulation: Dopamine plays a crucial role in mood regulation, and an imbalance in its levels has been associated with mood disorders. Proponents of dopamine detoxing argue that by rebalancing the brain's reward system, individuals may experience more stable and regulated moods, reducing the likelihood of mood swings and emotional highs and lows.

Mindfulness and reflection: The break from overstimulation during a dopamine detox provides an opportunity for mindfulness and self-reflection. Engaging in activities such as meditation, journaling, or simply spending time in nature can foster a deeper connection with one's thoughts and emotions, potentially leading to a greater understanding of oneself and improved mental well-being.

""Skilful balancing is key when experimenting with dopamine fasting. The intention is not to banish all delight, but to consciously recalibrate how we process pleasure. We can reshape our neural circuitry over time. Embark by integrating small, sustainable changes before attempting stringent deprivation. Each personï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s rhythm and needs differ; this practice should feel nourishing rather than punitive. Consider starting with brief, scheduled breaks from a single habit. Professional support can help craft a customized approach that suits your lifestyle. Periodic check-ins track progress and reveal which replacements feel most life-giving. It takes patience and compassion to change such engrained h"" concludes Dr Chandni.

Thanksgiving 2023: Giving thanks isn't just a holiday tradition. It's part of how humans evolved,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

How we got grateful

Humans are social animals. That's how we've lasted so long; not by being the biggest or the strongest, but by figuring out how to work together.

A key part of building relationships is the idea of reciprocity: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If you like me and do nice things for me, then I like you and do nice things for you,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Michael Tomasello, a developmental psychologist at Duke University.

The animal kingdom has some parallel give-and-take behaviors, said Malini Suchak, an animal behavior researcher at Canisius University. In experiments with capuchin monkeys and chimpanzees, Suchak found the primates became more willing to help out a partner if that individual had helped them in the past.

Some scientists think the feeling of gratitude evolved to keep the helping exchanges going. In other words, if you were helped, you'd feel like you should repay the debt with a good deed in return, said Jenae Nelson, who researches gratitude at Baylor and Harvard univýýThis give and take ýýý this is very, very primal and very important to a cooperative society,ýýý Nelson said. ýýýOtherwise, you just get a culture of takers.ýýý

In animals and in humans, these aren't always one-to-one transactions. Sometimes, an ape that gets groomed by another will later back that partner up in a fight, Suchak said, showing that reciprocity might not be about keeping exact scores, but forming broader emotional ties.

Though we can't ýýýspeak chimpýýý well enough to know if they're actually saying thanks, Suchak added, it makes sense that some form of this social debt showed up early in our lineage.

ýýýIt didn't just pop out of nowhere when humans evolved,"" Suchak said.

And how we stayed grateful

Thousands of years later, gratitude has taken root in humans.

Studies have found gratitude may show up in a few spots in our genes and brains ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ including ones linked to social bonding, feeling reward and seeing other people's point of view.

And the feeling emerges early on: Children as young as 2 and 3 demonstrate they want to return favors, said Amrisha Vaish, who studies moral development at the University of Virginia. At age 4, children also show a tendency to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pay it forward,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she added.

In a study, Vaish found that when kids got help completing a task ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ in this case, finding a key to unlock a box of stickers ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ they were more likely to share their sticker reward with a new person.

It's that kind of behavior that shows gratitude is more than simple exchange, Schnitker said. It can make us more generous with other people in general ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ even if they didn't help us first.

Giving thanks might be good for you, too: A 2e letters of gratitude reported better mental health and saw changes in their brain activity ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ even months down the line.

But Nelson pointed out that recognizing the giver, not just the gift, is key.

So, if Thanksgiving has you in a mood for gratitude, she suggested focusing on thanking the people in your life, rather than just making ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½gratitude listsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ of the stuff you have. This is more in line with why the feeling evolved in the first place, she said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's not just about stuff and materialism,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Nelson said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's about relationships, and the things that people do for you, and then the things that you can in turn do back for other people.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Winter raises pneumonia risk; protect your lungs with these lifestyle changes,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""Often, in our quick-paced lives, the significance of health is disregarded which can be deteriorated by various factors of living. Pneumonia is a potentially serious respiratory disease that can hit anyone but is more dangerous for people whose lifestyles could compromise their immune systems. These things include stress, poor diet, and lack of sleep, among others, which all weaken our body defences making us susceptible to these diseases,"" says Dr Anjali R Nath, Consultant Pulmonologist, SPARSH Hospital, Bangalore.

What is pneumonia? Know its symptoms

For a full recovery, it's important to diagnose and treat pneumonia on time to avoid deadly complications. In winters if you are having chest discomfort, coughing, lethargy, chills, fever, vomiting, you should get immediately consult a doctor.

""An infection that inflames the air sacs in either one or both lungs is called pneumonia. This condition can commonly affect both children and adults. The indicators of pneumonia include symptoms such as chest discomfort, coughing, expectoration, lethargy, perspiration, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, and breathing difficulties. Not treating it at the right time can lead to complications such as lung abscess,"" says Dr Samir Garde, Director of Dept of Pulmonology and Lung Transplant, Global Hospitals, Parel.

Dr Anjali says pneumonia has multiple effects on us and people who lead a sedentary or inactive lifestyle could bear the brunt of its myriad complications which could delay recovery process.

""The infection causes inflammation in the air sacs in the lungs and results in cough with mucus, fever, difficulty breathing and chest pain. For those already straining their bodies with an unhealthy lifestyle, pneumonia can have an even worse impact thus leading to delayed recovery and potential complications. To avoid complications, it is important to see a doctor if you have a persistent cough accompanied by a high fever or difficulty in breathing,"" says Dr Anjali.

""Navigating the effects of pneumonia can seem quite daunting, especially when it affects a vulnerable population which is children. Heightened symptoms like fever spikes, laborious breathing, or persistent coughing can be a matter of concern for parents and they may fret about the outcome of the disease,"" says Dr Vrushali Bichkar, Consultant Paediatrician and Neonatologist, Motherhood Hospital, Lullanagar, Pune.

Lifestyle choices to reduce risk of pneumonia

There's more to reducing your risk of pneumonia than just regular hand washing and avoiding sick contacts. You must delve deeper, starting with adopting a healthier lifestyle. Include seasonal fruits, probiotics in your diet and do workout and breathing exercises for improving lung capacity.

""The core pillars of this approach include good nutrition, ample physical activity, and enough restful sleep. Eat foods such as citrus fruits, garlic, and yogurt that boost immunity and inhibit bacterial growth believed to cause pneumonia. Routine physical activity improves lung capacity. A brisk 30-minute walk or light aerobic exercise daily should do the trick. It will also be imperative for one to rest well and get a good nightï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s sleep of a minimum of 8 "" says Dr Vrushali.

Dr Vrushali says stress is also one of the factors that make people prone to respiratory infections.

""Working towards mindfulness through meditation can help fortify your resolve in keeping up healthy customs even under duress since stressed people are particularly prone to respiratory infections! Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s time for us all to take a deep, health-replenishing breath followed by some crunching on antioxidant-rich greens and turning off late-night screens! Try to follow the instructions given by the doctor only and take medication on time. Hydration helps thin down thick mucus secretions, making it easier for little lungs to expel them while easing discomfort simultaneously. Remember this journey may appear turbulent at times but armed with these strategies and comprehensive medical intervention, the child with pneumonia can re"" she adds.

Agrees Dr Anjali who says pneumonia can be avoided by keeping your immune system powerful and robust. This is especially true for elderly who need to carve out a healthy routine for themselves.

""Prioritising healthy lifestyles can greatly reduce pneumonia risk. A powerful and resilient immune system comes from having fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in a balanced diet. Exercise not only improves general health but also helps the body to fight infections. Breathing exercises along with regular physical exercise also help in improving the lung capacity. While you sleep, your body renews itself; this makes adequate sleep very important. This is because chronic stress weakens the immune system. Moreover, older adults, those with underlying health problems, and people leading specific lifestyles should be more vigilant. Pneumonia has a higher chance of occurring in smokers; therefore, they have to stop smoking to maintain their respiratory health. In addition, the immune system becomes weaker due to excessive alcohol consumption hence making it susceptible to diseases,"" she adds.

Tips for treating pneumonia in children

If a child is diagnosed with pneumonia, it becomes crucial to adhere to certain important guidelines. Vaccination according to the expertï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s advice is key for children and maintaining the schedule for these immunizations is criti""In addition, flu vaccinations should also be considered for children. Regular medical check-ups and consultations are advisable. Practicing good hand hygiene and avoiding crowded areas or contact with sick people are recommended precautions. Pneumonia patients should engage in breathing exercises to enhance lung functionality and consider practices like yoga and meditation as well. Although exposure to cold weather doesn't directly result in pneumonia it does increase vulnerability due to compromised immunity and close indoor living conditions. Avoid being near someone who is coughing or sneezing as this significantly heightens your risk of acquiring this severe illness. Implementing these sensible daily habits along with caution can significantly help in preventing pneumonia infection. Ensuring adequate sleep, regular physical activity and a nutritious diet can strengthen immunity against various diseases, conditions, allergies, and infections. Go for scanning as per the doctor's instructions. Do not venture out when the air quality is poor and there is air pollution as it can take a toll on the lungs,"" says Dr Samir.

France also wants EU sanctions slapped on people linked to Hamas and its ally, Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah, like the sanctions the bloc has imposed on some Iranians over their role in the war in Ukraine.
The EU in February imposed sanctions on seven Iranian firms which make drones used by Russia to strike targets in Ukraine.
France's proposal could be adopted by EU foreign ministers in December, Boone said. It has the backing of Germany and Italy, according to her entourage.
The United States in October imposed sanctions against 10 ""key"" members of Hamas based in Gaza, Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar who are involved in financing the group's activities.
Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip following the October 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The group took 239 hostages.
Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,100 people have been killed in Israel's aerial and ground offensive since -- two thirds of them women and children.

Biden declares emergency in US Virgin Islands amid water contamination crisis,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Officials told residents to stop using their taps and began distributing vouchers for bottled water. Lead can have devastating effects on childhood development, behavior and IQ scores.
But experts consulted by The Associated Press said the frightening results may be false because they came from testing that does not meet EPA standards.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The data should be thrown into the garbage,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech lead and water expert who helped identify the lead problems in Flint, Michigan.
If the information given to St. Croix residents turns out to be bad, it won't be the first time that's happened. Poor information often plagues communities, and they are often majority-Black communities, facing lead crises, leaving people unsure what to believe. In Flint, officials initially concealed high lead levels. When levels spiked in Newark, officials emphasized the safety of the cityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s reservoirs even though it is lead pipes ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ not the source eproblem. In Benton Harbor, Michigan, residents waited months for officials to confirm that filters truly work, relying on bottled water.
On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, officials avoided some of those pitfalls and quickly told residents of the results. The governor declared an emergency.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is not something that we shy away from talking about,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ said Andrew Smith, head of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority.
Edwards does not believe the sky-high results reflect reality and said the problem is how the samples were collected. For lead testing, workers usually take water from a household faucet. But the samples that tested so high on St. Croix were collected from the meter.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When you (unscrew) it, you are literally ripping the leaded-brass apart and a chunk of leaded-brass gets in your sample,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said. It produces artificially high results.
Tom Neltner, a chemical and lead expert at the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed that testing from the water meter isn't ac of odditiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ about how St. Croix's sampling was done, he said.
Parents in St. Croix therefore still have no idea how much lead their kids were consuming.
Hereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s what is known:
In September, officials tested in the normal way, at faucets, following EPA lead testing rules. Those results showed the water was safe.
But island residents, who had long dealt with discolored water, said the color was getting even worse in recent months. So officials took more samples, this time at the meter, to see whether the utility's pipes were the problem. It is some of these tests that first recorded astronomically high lead levels.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We were all shocked and surprised by the results,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Smith said.
Retesting found results were still too high. Other locations including two schools, however, were low.
A more definitive answer should come soon. Local and federal officials did detailed testing to find the root cause in early November. A final report is expected in mid-December.
Smith said about 3,400 hot the utility worked with EPA on the sampling.
Even though the tests didn't follow the normal procedure, EPA water expert Christine Ash said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending that folks who use (utility) water piped to their homes not consume the water until we're able to do further investigation to identify if there is a potential source of lead and what it might be.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
Fortunately on St. Croix, that doesn't include everyone.
A lot of people rely on rainwater they collect in cisterns.
On the mainland, in many cities, lead pipes are the main threat to drinking water. That's not the problem on the island, however. Instead, it's brass fittings that contain lead and can corrode into the water, Smith said.
And regardless of the test results, the water system needs attention and fixing. Smith and his colleagues are flushing water through it. When people don't use the water, it sits and can pick up contaminants. They are also fixing how they treat their water so it is less corrosive to replace components that contain lead. That replacement work might take 12 to 18 months, Smith said. Plus, the islandï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s water system is old and in the coming years, major upgrades are planned.
Gerard said people on the island are overwhelmed.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s this sense of well, whatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s next for St. Croix?ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said, adding that residents have endured a devastating hurricane, the pandemic and water contamination from a refinery, all in recent years. Many people gave up on tap water long ago, she said, and it's hard to know what to make of these latest developments.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As a fairly literate person, reading the reports has almost left us with more questions than answers.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Many people probably donï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t understand just how high these lead test results are, she said.
As for the temporary measure of flushing lots of water through the pipes to reduce lead, it's ill-suited to the island, she said.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We're a water conserving society,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Gerard said. ï¿½e to Top

"Pope Francis meets Israelis, Palestinians. His warning to world on Mideast isï¿½","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
""Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond wars. This is not war, this is terrorism,"" he added, without specifying whether he was referring to the October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas or Israel's military operation in Gaza launched in response, or both.
The Vatican said last week the pope hoped to show his ""spiritual closeness"" during the private meetings, which it said would be ""exclusively humanitarian in nature"".
Each delegation told press conferences in Rome following the meetings that they believed Francis could use his moral influence to help them.
Hamas gunmen carried out on October 7 a cross-border attack, the worst in Israel's history, that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government.
Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, among them elderly people and young children.
In retaliation, Israel launched a major bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which the Hamas government said has killed 14,100 people, mostly civilians and thousands of them children.
""Let us pray that the difficulties resolve themselves in dialogue and negotiation and not with a mountain of dead on each side,"" Francis said in a video message released Wednesday.

""He's very respected in the Muslim world, in the Jewish world, really irrespective of religious background. So I think that when he speaks the world really listens.""
Palestinian Yousef Lalkhoury said the pope was capable of asking for a ""just peace"" for his people.
""We have urged him to visit Gaza because we believe he can stop the war,"" Lalkhoury said.
Short of freeing all the hostages, the Israeli delegation said it hoped Francis could push for the Red Cross to be allowed access to them.
- 'Broken heart' -
Israel and Hamas announced a deal on Wednesday allowing at least 50 hostages and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, while offering besieged Gaza residents a four-day truce after weeks of all-out war.
""I'm not counting hostages being freed in this deal until I see them walk over the border and see them embraced safely,"" said Goldberg, who was among 12 families of hostages represented in the meeting with the pope.
Muhamed Halalo, an IT manager from Gaza who lives in Belgium, was one of 10 Muslim and Christian Palestinians who met with Francis.
""I have a broken heart, my eyes full of tears,"" he said as he described how his entire extended family had been wiped out in a strike that killed 30 people.
Israeli Adav Kipnis said his parents were murdered during the October 7 attack and seven of his family members were kidnapped.
""We don't know if those captured are alive, if they are injured... Give us information if they are even alive and being taken care of,"" he said.
The Palestinians present claimed the pope used the word ""genocide"" during their meeting to describe what was happening in Gaza.
""I am not aware of him using that word,"" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni told AFP, adding that he had been present at the meeting.
The pope ""used the terms he used to express himself during the weekly audience and words that in any case represent the terrible situation in Gaza"", Bruni said.
The pope has never described it as genocide in public.
""He spoke to us about what he already knew about Gaza, and he's the one who described what's happened as a genocide"", Shireen Hilal from Bethlehem insisted.
""He said that terror cannot or should not justify terror"".

""This is unprecedented,"" said Russell, who had just returned from a trip to southern Gaza. ""I am haunted by what I saw and heard.""
Russell welcomed a deal reached Wednesday by Israel and Hamas to free hostages and pause ferocious fighting and bombardment in Gaza.
Some 240 people -- ranging from infants to the elderly -- were taken captive during the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed about 1,200 in Israel, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.
But Russell said that a pause is not enough and called for ""an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage.""
""For children to survive..., for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver..., humanitarian pauses are simply not enough,"" she said.
Russell said that an additional 1,200 children are believed to remain under the rubble of bombed-out buildings or are otherwise unaccounted for.
""In addition to bombs, rockets, and gunfire, Gaza's children are at extreme risk from catastrophic living conditions,"" Russell added.
""One million children -- or all children inside the territory -- are now food insecure, facing what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis.""
UNICEF estimates that acute malnutrition in children could increase by nearly 30 per cent in Gaza over the next months.
Also addressing the Security Council, the head of the United Nations Population Fund, Natalia Kanem, drew attention to the plight of Gaza's pregnant women, with some 5,500 expected to deliver babies under appalling conditions in the coming month.
""At a moment when new life is beginning, what should be a moment of joy is overshadowed by death and destruction, horror and fear,"" said Kanem.

Ukraine troops face 'difficult defence' in east: What Zelensky said,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
""Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south,"" Zelenskiy said on Telegram messenger.
Snow and freezing temperatures that stood at about minus 5 degrees Celsius during the day on Wednesday and were expected to drop lower may further complicate operations on the battleground, where fighting is moving to an attritional phase.
Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine. Kyiv launched a counteroffensive to retake occupied territory this summer, but has not forced a major breakthrough.
Since mid-October, Avdiivka, where the front line has changed little since the first war erupted in 2014 between Kyiv and Russian-backed militants, faced waves of attacks followed by temporary lulls, according to the Ukrainian military.
After one such lull the day before, the head of the ""Tavria"" military command said on Wednesday that Russian troops had ""dramatically increased"" the number of assaults and airstrikes.
""Our defenders are steadfastly holding the defence in the Avdiivka direction,"" Commander Oleksandr Tarnavskyi said on Telegram. Ukrainian forces continued the offensive on the southeastern Melitopol front, he added.
In their morning readout on the battlefield, the General Staff said troops were also holding onto the bridgeheads secured on the eastern side of the River Dnipro that was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of their invasion.
Reuters could not independently verify the frontline reports.

California's Marin County enforces extended mask mandate to curb COVID-19,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
Amidst global debates on the efficacy of face masks, a comprehensive review by the Royal Society in the UK in August unequivocally supported their role in reducing COVID-19 infections. However, this preventive measure has faced opposition from several prominent Republicans. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, for instance, signed a law prohibiting government agencies from enforcing mask mandates in the state.
In contrast, Marin County's decision aligns with its commitment to public health. The mandate carries potential penalties, including misdemeanours or jail time, for non-compliance. County officials clarified that the order aims to safeguard individuals in high-risk healthcare settings and curb the spread of respiratory viruses like RSV, influenza, and COVID-19.
""The intent of the order is to protect individuals in these high-risk healthcare settings and limit the spread of seasonal respiratory viruses,"" stated Marin County officials. The mandate applies to all individuals in patient care areas, with exemptions for children under age 6 and those with valid medical reasons.
While Marin County reinforces its commitment to public health, other regions in California, such as Huntington Beach, have taken a different stance, banning masks in the future after a lengthy city council meeting.
While temporary mask requirements have been implemented in various U.S. locations this year, a federal mask mandate remains improbable. Officials emphasize that the choice to wear masks will continue to be a personal decision, alongside other preventive measures like vaccinations, at-home testing, and treatments.
Jeff Nesbit, assistant secretary for public affairs for health and human services, reiterated in September, ""To be clear, the rumours of a federal mask mandate are not true."" The focus remains on providing a range of tools for individuals to protect themselves from the impact of COVID-19.

Kim Jong Un saw US military bases from new spy satellite? North Korea saysï¿½,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
But this time, North Korea heralded what it said was a successful launch of its new ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Malligyong-1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ satellite which would formally start its reconnaissance mission from Dec. 1 after some fine tuning, it said.
Kim Jong Un said an array of spy satellites is needed to closely monitor military maneuvers of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½US imperialists and their vassal armies,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which are endangering the regional situation, KCNA reported.
While Seoul believed that the spy satellite would not be of expert nature but it could help North Korea in understanding targets as it has designed missiles deliver nuclear strikes in South Korea and Japan.
Earlier this month, North Korea tested new engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles.
Hong Min, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for Nati""To assess the success of this launch, it is crucial not only to determine whether the projectile entered orbit but also to secure the ability to adjust and conduct reconnaissance from that orbit. This includes verifying the capability to take pictures with optical cameras and transmitting them appropriately to the satellite centre.""

Is North Korea's spy satellite working? Did Russia help? All you need to know,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.
WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES OF NORTH KOREA'S ON-ORBIT SPY SATELLITE?
What remains unconfirmed, however, is whether its payload, the reconnaissance satellite Malligyong-1, is operating in orbit, and whether the North received any outside help.
It may take some time to determine whether the satellite is in operational orbit, is sending signals, and what its capabilities are, analysts said.
""To assess the success of this launch, it is crucial not only to determine whether the projectile entered orbit but also to secure the ability to adjust and conduct reconnaissance from that orbit,"" said Hong Min, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""This includes verifying the capability to take pictures with optical cameras and transmitting them appropriately to the satellite centre.""
ALSO READ| Turkey's Erdogan on Hamas war: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Force Israel to comply with international lawï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
HOW COULD THE SPY SATELLITE BE USED?
North Korea has not shown imagery of the satellite, but photos released by state media from a visit leader Kim Jong Un made this year to a production facility showed small, solar-powered satellites that are most likely similar to the one launched on Tuesday, said Vann Van Diepen, a former U.S. government weapons expert who works with the Stimson Center in ""It's likely that this is a relatively small, optical satellite that is going to have relatively low resolution,"" he told Reuters. ""But even a relatively low-resolution satellite is better than not having a satellite, which is their current situation.""
Such a satellite is unlikely to provide the North with detailed intelligence on specific weapons systems in South Korea, for example, but it would still be useful for identifying things such as large troop movements, Van Diepen added.
To launch a more-capable satellite, North Korea will most likely need to develop a larger rocket, which it appears to be doing, he said.
After the first failed test, South Korea recovered some of the Chollima-1 wreckage - including, for the first time, parts of a satellite, which it said had little military value.
IS RUSSIA HELPING?
South Korea's spy agency has said North Korea may have overcome technical hurdles with the help of Russia, which in September publicly pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites.
Many experts expressed doubts, however, that Moscow could have provided game-changing assistance in the roughly two months since then.
""It's much too early for the North Koreans to have integrated any assistance Russia may have agreed to supply,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said in a post on the social media platform X. ""Maybe the Russians gave them some advice, but it's normal for countries to launch and learn.""
Chang Young-keun, a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said it would have been impossible for the North to rebuild a satellite with Russian technology or hardware assistance within that time.
""But Russia could have offered some analysis on previous failures and telemetry data,"" he said.
Replacing parts, improving software, system integration, and test runs can't typically be done quickly, but Russian support could still be valuable in key areas such as improving the satellite's capabilities or resolving the combustion instability that plagued an earlier launch, said Lee Choon-geun, a rocket expert at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute.
DO NORTH KOREA'S LATEST SATELLITE TESTS HAVE TIES TO MISSILE PROGRAMS?
The United States and its allies called North Korea's latest satellite tests clear violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which prohibit development of technology applicable to North Korea's ballistic missile programs.
U.N. resolutions - passed with Russia's support - also ban any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods.
The Chollima-1 seems to be a new design and most likely uses the dual-nozzle liquid-fuelled engines developed for Pyongyangï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which has roots in Soviet designs, analysts said.

However, although the space launch vehicle (SLV) probably uses the same RD250-like engines as North Korea's ICBMs, there are design differences between the two, Lewis s""North Korea is no longer shy about testing ICBMs, so no - this really is an SLV,"" he said.

Her aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali, who lives in Los Angeles, told CNN on Tuesday night that the family has been anxiously waiting for news about Abigail for seven weeks.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The one thing that we all hold on to is that hope now that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ she said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Friday is her 4th birthday. We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

She said she hopes that Abigail is being cared for by the woman who was with her when she was kidnapped, along with her three children.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½And I hope that Abigail is being taken care of and left [alone] and that the deal will follow through and these hostages will be back home with their families in the next couple of days.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

Abigail is one of the three American hostages who are set to be released under the agreement that was reached on Tuesday, which also  said in a statement that he will not rest until all the American hostages are released.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ he said.

A senior administration official also told CNN that the deal is designed to ensure the release of all the hostages.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are determined to get everybody home,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the official said.

ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The way the deal is structured, it very much incentivizes the release of everybody.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½

The deal involves a temporary cease-fire in Gaza and Israel, which will start at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to Egyptï¿½ï¿½ï¿½s state-run Qahera TV channel. Egypt mediated the negotiations between Hamas and Israel.

In exchange for the cease-fire, Hamas agreed to release 50 women and children hostages, while Israel agreed to release a similar number ochildren.

The cease-fire will provide some relief to Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and many more are suffering from the lack of food, water, electricity and medicine.

The senior official told CNN that the cease-fire could be extended if Hamas agrees to release more of the 240 Israeli hostages that it holds.

Europe's largest nuclear reactor resumes production after technical fault,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The reactor went back online after midnight and was running at 1,400 MW at 1:30 pm (1130 GMT), expecting to reach full output of around 1,600 MW by the end of the day.

TVO said Monday the reactor, located on Finland's southwest coast, ""was in normal production when a fault in the turbine plant automatically stopped the facility's electricity production.""

""The cause of the fault was revealed to be a malfunctioning temperature measurement in the generator's cooling system,"" it said, adding that ""the incident had no impact on nuclear safety.""

The next-generation European pressurised water reactor (EPR), built by the French-led Areva-Siemens consortium, produces more than 10 percent of Finland's electricity.

After 14 years of delays, the reactor was put into regular service in April 2023.

Like several other EPR projects, it was plagued by repeated construction delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns.

Olkiluoto 3 is the single largest nuclear reactor in Europe, while Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia plant, with its six reactors, is the largest nuclear plant.
