"US- Canada border closed after vehicle explosion on bridge, FBI responds","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The state agencies are on site, the governor informed as US media reported that all four international border crossings between the United States and Canada in Western New York were closed due to an incident involving a vehicle at the Rainbow Bridge.

The Rainbow Bridge is one of four border crossings connecting Ontario to New York. The others are Lewiston, Whirlpool and Peace Bridge.

The FBI is investigating the vehicle explosion at the border crossing between the United States and Canada, the US law enforcement agency said in a statement as per news agency Reuters.

“The FBI is coordinating with our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners in this investigation. As this situation is very fluid, that’s all we can say at this time,"" it said.

The CEO of the Buffalo & Fort Erie Public bridge authority said,

“Currently all four international bridges over the Niagara River are closed as the incident is being investigated,” said CEO Ron Rienas.

Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, which borders New York, said, “Our provincial law enforcement is actively engaged in assessing the situation.

He informed, ""They are working with local law enforcement and are providing support as required.”

Photos and videos widely shared online showed a security booth which was burnt after the explosion.

A 27-year-old man was taken to Niagara Falls Memorial Hospital with minor injuries, including back pain and minor cuts but his condition is not severe, Fox News reported.

In response to the vehicle explosion, the Niagara Falls International Airport is increasing security at the airport and rail system, reports suggested.

France calls for EU sanctions against Hamas officials,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The idea would be to ""specifically target certain individuals"" with ""mainly financial"" sanctions such as an asset freeze, she added without specifying who should be targeted.

France also wants EU sanctions slapped on people linked to Hamas and its ally, Lebanon's pro-Iran Hezbollah, like the sanctions the bloc has imposed on some Iranians over their role in the war in Ukraine.

The EU in February imposed sanctions on seven Iranian firms which make drones used by Russia to strike targets in Ukraine.

France's proposal could be adopted by EU foreign ministers in December, Boone said. It has the backing of Germany and Italy, according to her entourage.

The United States in October imposed sanctions against 10 ""key"" members of Hamas based in Gaza, Sudan, Turkey, Algeria and Qatar who are involved in financing the group's activities.

Israel has bombarded the Gaza Strip following the October 7 attack by Hamas that Israel says killed 1,200 people. The group took 239 hostages.

Gaza's Hamas-run government says more than 14,100 people have been killed in Israel's aerial and ground offensive since -- two thirds of them women and children.

Biden declares emergency in US Virgin Islands amid water contamination crisis,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Officials told residents to stop using their taps and began distributing vouchers for bottled water. Lead can have devastating effects on childhood development, behavior and IQ scores.

But experts consulted by The Associated Press said the frightening results may be false because they came from testing that does not meet EPA standards.

“The data should be thrown into the garbage,” said Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech lead and water expert who helped identify the lead problems in Flint, Michigan.

If the information given to St. Croix residents turns out to be bad, it won't be the first time that's happened. Poor information often plagues communities, and they are often majority-Black communities, facing lead crises, leaving people unsure what to believe. In Flint, officials initially concealed high lead levels. When levels spiked in Newark, officials emphasized the safety of the city’s reservoirs even though it is lead pipes – not the source – that are usually the problem. In Benton Harbor, Michigan, residents waited months for officials to confirm that filters truly work, relying on bottled water.

On the Caribbean island of St. Croix, officials avoided some of those pitfalls and quickly told residents of the results. The governor declared an emergency.

“This is not something that we shy away from talking about,” said Andrew Smith, head of the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority.

Edwards does not believe the sky-high results reflect reality and said the problem is how the samples were collected. For lead testing, workers usually take water from a household faucet. But the samples that tested so high on St. Croix were collected from the meter.

“When you (unscrew) it, you are literally ripping the leaded-brass apart and a chunk of leaded-brass gets in your sample,” he said. It produces artificially high results.

Tom Neltner, a chemical and lead expert at the Environmental Defense Fund, agreed that testing from the water meter isn't accurate. “There's a lot of oddities” about how St. Croix's sampling was done, he said.

Parents in St. Croix therefore still have no idea how much lead their kids were consuming.

Here’s what is known:

In September, officials tested in the normal way, at faucets, following EPA lead testing rules. Those results showed the water was safe.

But island residents, who had long dealt with discolored water, said the color was getting even worse in recent months. So officials took more samples, this time at the meter, to see whether the utility's pipes were the problem. It is some of these tests that first recorded astronomically high lead levels.

“We were all shocked and surprised by the results,” Smith said.

Retesting found results were still too high. Other locations including two schools, however, were low.

A more definitive answer should come soon. Local and federal officials did detailed testing to find the root cause in early November. A final report is expected in mid-December.

Smith said about 3,400 homes are affected and that the utility worked with EPA on the sampling.

Even though the tests didn't follow the normal procedure, EPA water expert Christine Ash said “out of an abundance of caution, we are recommending that folks who use (utility) water piped to their homes not consume the water until we're able to do further investigation to identify if there is a potential source of lead and what it might be.”

Fortunately on St. Croix, that doesn't include everyone.

A lot of people rely on rainwater they collect in cisterns.

On the mainland, in many cities, lead pipes are the main threat to drinking water. That's not the problem on the island, however. Instead, it's brass fittings that contain lead and can corrode into the water, Smith said.

And regardless of the test results, the water system needs attention and fixing. Smith and his colleagues are flushing water through it. When people don't use the water, it sits and can pick up contaminants. They are also fixing how they treat their water so it is less corrosive and working to replace components that contain lead. That replacement work might take 12 to 18 months, Smith said. Plus, the island’s water system is old and in the coming years, major upgrades are planned.

Gerard said people on the island are overwhelmed.

“There’s this sense of well, what’s next for St. Croix?” she said, adding that residents have endured a devastating hurricane, the pandemic and water contamination from a refinery, all in recent years. Many people gave up on tap water long ago, she said, and it's hard to know what to make of these latest developments.

“As a fairly literate person, reading the reports has almost left us with more questions than answers.” Many people probably don’t understand just how high these lead test results are, she said.

As for the temporary measure of flushing lots of water through the pipes to reduce lead, it's ill-suited to the island, she said.

“We're a water conserving society,” Gerard said. “Water is a precious commodity.”

Pakistan applies for BRICS membership; seeks Russia's support,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Jamali said Pakistan has already applied for membership in the BRICS-Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa which sis set to expand next year with the admission of six new members under the Russian Presidency.

Pakistan’s application to join the BRICS came as the grouping of emerging economies was set for its biggest expansion with six new members under Russia’s rotating Presidency in 2024.

READ | Pakistan says Brics member blocked participation in Beijing meeting

This year’s BRICS summit held in South Africa formally admitted Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as new members. They will formally join during the 2024 summit in Russia.

Jamali said Islamabad plans to join the group under Russia’s presidency next year.

""Pakistan would like to be part of this important organisation and we are in the process of contacting member countries for extending support to Pakistan’s membership in general and the Russian Federation in particular,"" he said.

The TASS report said that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said in early October that BRICS plans to agree on a list of candidates for partner-state status ahead of the upcoming summit in Kazan in 2024.

While Pakistan, currently facing its worst economic and political crisis perhaps can count on the support of its all-weather ally China, it is to be seen how the other four members, Brazil, Russia India and South Africa would react to the proposal to admit Islamabad.

The five-member bloc first started as BRIC, (Brazil, Russia, India, China) which was formed after a meeting of its leaders on the margins of the G8 Outreach Summit in 2006 in Russia and held its first summit in 2009.

It later became BRICS with the admission of South Africa and emerged as an influential organisation with the establishment of a bank of its own, called the New Development Bank (NDB) based in Shanghai.

"Pope Francis meets Israelis, Palestinians. His warning to world on Mideast is…","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""Wars do this, but here we have gone beyond wars. This is not war, this is terrorism,"" he added, without specifying whether he was referring to the October 7 attack on Israel by Palestinian militant group Hamas or Israel's military operation in Gaza launched in response, or both.

The Vatican said last week the pope hoped to show his ""spiritual closeness"" during the private meetings, which it said would be ""exclusively humanitarian in nature"".

Each delegation told press conferences in Rome following the meetings that they believed Francis could use his moral influence to help them.

Hamas gunmen carried out on October 7 a cross-border attack, the worst in Israel's history, that left around 1,200 people dead, most of them civilians, according to the Israeli government.

Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups also took an estimated 240 Israelis and foreigners hostage, among them elderly people and young children.

In retaliation, Israel launched a major bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza, which the Hamas government said has killed 14,100 people, mostly civilians and thousands of them children.

""Let us pray that the difficulties resolve themselves in dialogue and negotiation and not with a mountain of dead on each side,"" Francis said in a video message released Wednesday.

Rachel Goldberg, whose 23-year-old son Hersh Goldberg-Polin was kidnapped by Hamas, told journalists the pope ""has a lot of influence"".

""He's very respected in the Muslim world, in the Jewish world, really irrespective of religious background. So I think that when he speaks the world really listens.""

Palestinian Yousef Lalkhoury said the pope was capable of asking for a ""just peace"" for his people.

""We have urged him to visit Gaza because we believe he can stop the war,"" Lalkhoury said.

Short of freeing all the hostages, the Israeli delegation said it hoped Francis could push for the Red Cross to be allowed access to them.

- 'Broken heart' -

Israel and Hamas announced a deal on Wednesday allowing at least 50 hostages and scores of Palestinian prisoners to be freed, while offering besieged Gaza residents a four-day truce after weeks of all-out war.

""I'm not counting hostages being freed in this deal until I see them walk over the border and see them embraced safely,"" said Goldberg, who was among 12 families of hostages represented in the meeting with the pope.

Muhamed Halalo, an IT manager from Gaza who lives in Belgium, was one of 10 Muslim and Christian Palestinians who met with Francis.

""I have a broken heart, my eyes full of tears,"" he said as he described how his entire extended family had been wiped out in a strike that killed 30 people.

Israeli Adav Kipnis said his parents were murdered during the October 7 attack and seven of his family members were kidnapped.

""We don't know if those captured are alive, if they are injured... Give us information if they are even alive and being taken care of,"" he said.

The Palestinians present claimed the pope used the word ""genocide"" during their meeting to describe what was happening in Gaza.

""I am not aware of him using that word,"" Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni told AFP, adding that he had been present at the meeting.

The pope ""used the terms he used to express himself during the weekly audience and words that in any case represent the terrible situation in Gaza"", Bruni said.

The pope has never described it as genocide in public.

""He spoke to us about what he already knew about Gaza, and he's the one who described what's happened as a genocide"", Shireen Hilal from Bethlehem insisted.

""He said that terror cannot or should not justify terror"".

UNICEF says Gaza world's 'most dangerous place' for children: ‘To survive…’,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""This is unprecedented,"" said Russell, who had just returned from a trip to southern Gaza. ""I am haunted by what I saw and heard.""

Russell welcomed a deal reached Wednesday by Israel and Hamas to free hostages and pause ferocious fighting and bombardment in Gaza.

Some 240 people -- ranging from infants to the elderly -- were taken captive during the October 7 attack by Hamas militants that killed about 1,200 in Israel, mostly civilians, according to Israeli authorities.

But Russell said that a pause is not enough and called for ""an urgent humanitarian ceasefire to immediately put a stop to this carnage.""

""For children to survive..., for humanitarian workers to stay and effectively deliver..., humanitarian pauses are simply not enough,"" she said.

Russell said that an additional 1,200 children are believed to remain under the rubble of bombed-out buildings or are otherwise unaccounted for.

""In addition to bombs, rockets, and gunfire, Gaza's children are at extreme risk from catastrophic living conditions,"" Russell added.

""One million children -- or all children inside the territory -- are now food insecure, facing what could soon become a catastrophic nutrition crisis.""

UNICEF estimates that acute malnutrition in children could increase by nearly 30 per cent in Gaza over the next months.

Also addressing the Security Council, the head of the United Nations Population Fund, Natalia Kanem, drew attention to the plight of Gaza's pregnant women, with some 5,500 expected to deliver babies under appalling conditions in the coming month.

""At a moment when new life is beginning, what should be a moment of joy is overshadowed by death and destruction, horror and fear,"" said Kanem.

Ukraine troops face 'difficult defence' in east: What Zelensky said,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

""Difficult weather, difficult defence on the Lyman, Bakhmut, Donetsk and Avdiivka fronts. Offensive actions in the south,"" Zelenskiy said on Telegram messenger.

Snow and freezing temperatures that stood at about minus 5 degrees Celsius during the day on Wednesday and were expected to drop lower may further complicate operations on the battleground, where fighting is moving to an attritional phase.

Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022, controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine. Kyiv launched a counteroffensive to retake occupied territory this summer, but has not forced a major breakthrough.

Since mid-October, Avdiivka, where the front line has changed little since the first war erupted in 2014 between Kyiv and Russian-backed militants, faced waves of attacks followed by temporary lulls, according to the Ukrainian military.

After one such lull the day before, the head of the ""Tavria"" military command said on Wednesday that Russian troops had ""dramatically increased"" the number of assaults and airstrikes.

""Our defenders are steadfastly holding the defence in the Avdiivka direction,"" Commander Oleksandr Tarnavskyi said on Telegram. Ukrainian forces continued the offensive on the southeastern Melitopol front, he added.

In their morning readout on the battlefield, the General Staff said troops were also holding onto the bridgeheads secured on the eastern side of the River Dnipro that was occupied by Russian forces in the early days of their invasion.

Reuters could not independently verify the frontline reports.

California's Marin County enforces extended mask mandate to curb COVID-19,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Amidst global debates on the efficacy of face masks, a comprehensive review by the Royal Society in the UK in August unequivocally supported their role in reducing COVID-19 infections. However, this preventive measure has faced opposition from several prominent Republicans. Texas Governor Greg Abbott, for instance, signed a law prohibiting government agencies from enforcing mask mandates in the state.

In contrast, Marin County's decision aligns with its commitment to public health. The mandate carries potential penalties, including misdemeanours or jail time, for non-compliance. County officials clarified that the order aims to safeguard individuals in high-risk healthcare settings and curb the spread of respiratory viruses like RSV, influenza, and COVID-19.

""The intent of the order is to protect individuals in these high-risk healthcare settings and limit the spread of seasonal respiratory viruses,"" stated Marin County officials. The mandate applies to all individuals in patient care areas, with exemptions for children under age 6 and those with valid medical reasons.

While Marin County reinforces its commitment to public health, other regions in California, such as Huntington Beach, have taken a different stance, banning masks in the future after a lengthy city council meeting.

While temporary mask requirements have been implemented in various U.S. locations this year, a federal mask mandate remains improbable. Officials emphasize that the choice to wear masks will continue to be a personal decision, alongside other preventive measures like vaccinations, at-home testing, and treatments.

Jeff Nesbit, assistant secretary for public affairs for health and human services, reiterated in September, ""To be clear, the rumours of a federal mask mandate are not true."" The focus remains on providing a range of tools for individuals to protect themselves from the impact of COVID-19.

Kim Jong Un saw US military bases from new spy satellite? North Korea says…,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

But this time, North Korea heralded what it said was a successful launch of its new “Malligyong-1” satellite which would formally start its reconnaissance mission from Dec. 1 after some fine tuning, it said.

Kim Jong Un said an array of spy satellites is needed to closely monitor military maneuvers of the “US imperialists and their vassal armies,” which are endangering the regional situation, KCNA reported.

While Seoul believed that the spy satellite would not be of expert nature but it could help North Korea in understanding targets as it has designed missiles deliver nuclear strikes in South Korea and Japan.

Earlier this month, North Korea tested new engines for intermediate-range ballistic missiles.

Hong Min, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said, ""To assess the success of this launch, it is crucial not only to determine whether the projectile entered orbit but also to secure the ability to adjust and conduct reconnaissance from that orbit. This includes verifying the capability to take pictures with optical cameras and transmitting them appropriately to the satellite centre.""

Is North Korea's spy satellite working? Did Russia help? All you need to know,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

WHAT ARE THE CAPABILITIES OF NORTH KOREA'S ON-ORBIT SPY SATELLITE?

What remains unconfirmed, however, is whether its payload, the reconnaissance satellite Malligyong-1, is operating in orbit, and whether the North received any outside help.

It may take some time to determine whether the satellite is in operational orbit, is sending signals, and what its capabilities are, analysts said.

""To assess the success of this launch, it is crucial not only to determine whether the projectile entered orbit but also to secure the ability to adjust and conduct reconnaissance from that orbit,"" said Hong Min, a senior fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""This includes verifying the capability to take pictures with optical cameras and transmitting them appropriately to the satellite centre.""

HOW COULD THE SPY SATELLITE BE USED?

North Korea has not shown imagery of the satellite, but photos released by state media from a visit leader Kim Jong Un made this year to a production facility showed small, solar-powered satellites that are most likely similar to the one launched on Tuesday, said Vann Van Diepen, a former U.S. government weapons expert who works with the Stimson Center in Washington.

""It's likely that this is a relatively small, optical satellite that is going to have relatively low resolution,"" he told Reuters. ""But even a relatively low-resolution satellite is better than not having a satellite, which is their current situation.""

Such a satellite is unlikely to provide the North with detailed intelligence on specific weapons systems in South Korea, for example, but it would still be useful for identifying things such as large troop movements, Van Diepen added.

To launch a more-capable satellite, North Korea will most likely need to develop a larger rocket, which it appears to be doing, he said.

After the first failed test, South Korea recovered some of the Chollima-1 wreckage - including, for the first time, parts of a satellite, which it said had little military value.

IS RUSSIA HELPING?

South Korea's spy agency has said North Korea may have overcome technical hurdles with the help of Russia, which in September publicly pledged to help Pyongyang build satellites.

Many experts expressed doubts, however, that Moscow could have provided game-changing assistance in the roughly two months since then.

""It's much too early for the North Koreans to have integrated any assistance Russia may have agreed to supply,"" Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said in a post on the social media platform X. ""Maybe the Russians gave them some advice, but it's normal for countries to launch and learn.""

Chang Young-keun, a professor at Korea Aerospace University, said it would have been impossible for the North to rebuild a satellite with Russian technology or hardware assistance within that time.

""But Russia could have offered some analysis on previous failures and telemetry data,"" he said.

Replacing parts, improving software, system integration, and test runs can't typically be done quickly, but Russian support could still be valuable in key areas such as improving the satellite's capabilities or resolving the combustion instability that plagued an earlier launch, said Lee Choon-geun, a rocket expert at South Korea's Science and Technology Policy Institute.

DO NORTH KOREA'S LATEST SATELLITE TESTS HAVE TIES TO MISSILE PROGRAMS?

The United States and its allies called North Korea's latest satellite tests clear violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which prohibit development of technology applicable to North Korea's ballistic missile programs.

U.N. resolutions - passed with Russia's support - also ban any scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea in nuclear science and technology, aerospace and aeronautical engineering and technology, or advanced manufacturing production techniques and methods.

The Chollima-1 seems to be a new design and most likely uses the dual-nozzle liquid-fuelled engines developed for Pyongyang’s Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), which has roots in Soviet designs, analysts said.

However, although the space launch vehicle (SLV) probably uses the same RD250-like engines as North Korea's ICBMs, there are design differences between the two, Lewis said.

""North Korea is no longer shy about testing ICBMs, so no - this really is an SLV,"" he said.

US family awaits release of 3-year-old girl in Israel-Hamas hostage deal by her 4th birthday,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Her aunt Liz Hirsh Naftali, who lives in Los Angeles, told CNN on Tuesday night that the family has been anxiously waiting for news about Abigail for seven weeks.

“The one thing that we all hold on to is that hope now that Abigail comes home, she comes home by Friday,” she said.

“Friday is her 4th birthday. We need to see Abigail come out and then we will be able to believe it.”

She said she hopes that Abigail is being cared for by the woman who was with her when she was kidnapped, along with her three children.

“And I hope that Abigail is being taken care of and left [alone] and that the deal will follow through and these hostages will be back home with their families in the next couple of days.”

Abigail is one of the three American hostages who are set to be released under the agreement that was reached on Tuesday, which also includes two women.

President Biden said in a statement that he will not rest until all the American hostages are released.

“Today’s deal should bring home additional American hostages, and I will not stop until they are all released,” he said.

A senior administration official also told CNN that the deal is designed to ensure the release of all the hostages.

“We are determined to get everybody home,” the official said.

“The way the deal is structured, it very much incentivizes the release of everybody.”

The deal involves a temporary cease-fire in Gaza and Israel, which will start at 10 a.m. local time on Thursday, according to Egypt’s state-run Qahera TV channel. Egypt mediated the negotiations between Hamas and Israel.

In exchange for the cease-fire, Hamas agreed to release 50 women and children hostages, while Israel agreed to release a similar number of Palestinian prisoners, who are also women and children.

The cease-fire will provide some relief to Gaza, where more than 11,000 people have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and many more are suffering from the lack of food, water, electricity and medicine.

The senior official told CNN that the cease-fire could be extended if Hamas agrees to release more of the 240 Israeli hostages that it holds.

Europe's largest nuclear reactor resumes production after technical fault,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The reactor went back online after midnight and was running at 1,400 MW at 1:30 pm (1130 GMT), expecting to reach full output of around 1,600 MW by the end of the day.

TVO said Monday the reactor, located on Finland's southwest coast, ""was in normal production when a fault in the turbine plant automatically stopped the facility's electricity production.""

""The cause of the fault was revealed to be a malfunctioning temperature measurement in the generator's cooling system,"" it said, adding that ""the incident had no impact on nuclear safety.""

The next-generation European pressurised water reactor (EPR), built by the French-led Areva-Siemens consortium, produces more than 10 percent of Finland's electricity.

After 14 years of delays, the reactor was put into regular service in April 2023.

Like several other EPR projects, it was plagued by repeated construction delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns.

Olkiluoto 3 is the single largest nuclear reactor in Europe, while Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia plant, with its six reactors, is the largest nuclear plant.
