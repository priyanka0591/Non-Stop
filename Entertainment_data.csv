Lana Del Rey says she's ‘absolutely not in love’ after recent heartbreak,"American singer-songwriter Lana Del Rey has opened up on her recent heartbreak. The 38-year-old artist got candid about being in love and falling out of it in a tell-all interview with Harper's Bazaar. “I’m definitely not in love right now. No, absolutely not in love. Have been, but no,” the Summertime Sadness hitmaker declared. Lana also explained what caused the rift between her and her recent ex-boyfriend. Lana Del Rey is not in love anymore(YouTube)

Recalling the days leading up to her breakup, the Say Yes To Heaven singer said that her former boyfriend didn't like her house and they had several fights over it. Apparently, the simplicity of the pop icon's house is not easy to digest for some. Lana revealed that many people have shown their contempt for her house. “We had some fights over this house, a couple people,” she said, adding, “They didn't get it.”

“I feel like even the most chill guy doesn’t really want to chill here,” the Cinnamon Girl singer said while talking about her house. Lana then expressed her shock over her recent breakup, saying, “Sadly, part of you knows … that ain’t it. … That one shocked me.” She added, “I won’t name names and whatever, but that one really shocked me, that person. That was actually the end of a relationship.” For the Young and Beautiful singer, it was a “tough nut to swallow.”

Lana also told the outlet that her recent ex only liked the “idea of her” but couldn't really accept her for who she really is. She said, “In that person’s case, there was something going on with them, like a little bubble ego. See, I don’t get to have one anymore. It’s been smashed to … what do you call it? Smithereens. I’m sure it’s somewhere in my toe. That’s it. I’d love to grow one.” “I’m learning how. I’m learning. I know what I want,” she added.",Entertainment
"Coldplay concert in Malaysia could be stopped via ‘kill switch’ if the band misbehaves, government says","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Communication and Digital Minister Fahmi Fadzil said he doesn't foresee any problem with Coldplay's first concert in Malaysia later in the night. Security has been beefed up for the show that is expected to draw some 75,000 people at a stadium outside Kuala Lumpur.

“Yes, it's one of the things we have discussed with the organizer,” Fahmi said when asked if a 'kill switch"" to cut off power supply will be used.

“The prime minister has also said the band, you know, is very supportive of Palestine. So, we are upbeat about the concert today,” he added.

Malaysia introduced the kill switch measure recently after a controversy sparked by British band The 1975 in Kuala Lumpur in July. The band's lead singer slammed the country’s anti-gay laws and kissed a male bandmate during their performance, sparking a backlash among Muslims and prompted the government to cut short a three-day music festival.

Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has justified allowing the Coldplay concert, telling Parliament on Tuesday that “Coldplay is actually among the bands that support Palestine."" He noted that the previous administration, before he took power in November 2022, had approved the concert. Anwar said pro-Palestinian groups also approached his office in support of the Coldplay concert.

The opposition Islamic party PAS slammed Anwar's stance. While Coldplay supports the Palestinian cause, it also encourages hedonism, said its information chief Ahmad Fadhli Shaari.

“This is not about whether they purely support the Palestinian cause or not but the issue of hedonism culture that they bring to our community,” he said Tuesday in Parliament. PAS, which has expanded its influence following strong Muslim support in the 2022 elections, often protests concerts by international artists that it said were incompatible with Muslim values.

Officials from concert organizer Live Nation Malaysia couldn't be immediately reached for comment. It issued a statement to concert-goers a few days ago, reminding them to be “mindful of local cultures and sensitivities” and refrain from displaying props or items that may cause discomfort to others.

Police have warned the public to refrain from any sort of provocation and inciting unrest at the concert, which is part of Coldplay's Music of the Spheres World Tour.

Coldplay also met with resistance from Muslims when they performed in Indonesia earlier this month. Protesters held rallies right up to the day of its concert, slamming the band as an LGBTQ “propagandist” whose stance damages “faith and morals.”

Coldplay is renowned for interlacing its values with its shows, such as the band’s push for environmental sustainability. Lead singer Chris Martin has been known to wear rainbow colors and wave gay pride flags during performances.

"Anubhav Singh Bassi on comedy finding a place in the market: I can afford big auditoriums, sell tickets at a good price","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

He goes on, “Unko realize hua ki ye live art hi form hai aur ye Youtube par dekhne wali cheez nahi hai. And sheerly through word of mouth, we have reached to a place where we are organising these events at such grand venues with capacity to accommodate more and more people.”

Some time back, talking on the same lines, comedian and Emmy winner Vir Das had also shared on Instagram that comedy wasn’t considered a “theatrical art form” until two years ago and auditorium owners would not give their place to comedians. Bassi also agrees with Das’ comment and goes on to point out how there is another reason behind comedians finally being able to perform on bigger stages and are given the due respect.

”Comedians earlier were not able to afford the cost of these auditoriums. But now, as people want to come and witness the live performance, I could increase the ticket prices. People are willing to spend money to watch my show. Cost of my VIP tickets (for Kisi Ko Batana Mat) is ₹3500 approximately and people don’t mind paying for it. I am able to afford the expenses of the sound recording, the stadium and more. Auditorium owner don’t mind anything as long as they are paid,” shares Bassi who was seen in Tu Jhoothi Main Makkaar recently alongside Ranbir Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor.

While he is at the top of his career, enjoying the brighter side of the showbiz, is he ready to face the downfall as and when it comes? But Bassi has no fears about it. Confidently he tells us, “I am not afraid of it because I understand that it will happen…that time will come…one day or the other. I know mera waqt khatam hojaaega aur naye artistes aajaenge. But jitna maine life me achieve kara hai, agar wo chala bhi jaaega toh mujhe ye satisfaction rahegi ki maine apne time acche se jee liya. I will be content and happy.""

""So I am grateful for all the love and appreciation coming my way, but I cannot become greedy and expect to get the same level of it throughout my life,” Bassi ends.

Orry shared the video on his IG page and wrote, “I never ever want to be asked 'bhoi tu karta kya he ever (bro, what do you do) again.' Now you know. Cat's out of the bag.”

How the internet reacted

Internet was amused by his peculiar reply. “Rich kids are liver. We are appendix,"" read a comment. Another called him, “Narayan Murthy's worst nightmare.” A comment also read, “After listening to this, I’m leaving. I am a leaver.”

A person also defended Orry's choice to simply not have a job. “People unhappy with their own lives, because they’re not able to achieve anything, will obviously comment hate on to Orry’s lifestyle. You need to understand that he doesn’t need to work like you! Even you’re not working the way you should so why should he.”

A marketing genius?

Orry also shared a post about how he might actually be a marketing genius who might soon become ‘famous for being famous’ like the Kardashians. Orry, however, said that the post might not be 100% true.

These days, he is known for his cosy pictures with celebrities at Diwali and birthday parties, being BFFs with all the star kids and his whacky phone covers.

Taylor Swift night on Dancing With the Stars recap: Here's who went home during week 9,"This week's theme on Dancing With the Stars was Taylor Swift night, inspired by the pop sensation's ongoing Eras Tour. With exhilarating dance numbers on the 33-year-old singer's hits like Cruel Summer and Look What You Made Me Do, it's safe to say that the whole place shimmered. Well, in this case, the whole stage did. The top performers for the night were singer-songwriter Jason Mraz and his partner Daniella Karagach, scoring a perfect 40 for their Argentine tango performance to Swift's Dont Blame Me. This week's theme for DWTS was Taylor Swift night(Instagram/ DWTS)

To make things more exciting on the ninth episode of Dancing With The Stars Season 32, Eras Tour lead choreographer Mandy Moore made an appearance as a guest judge. Although the star of the night couldn't be there amid her busy schedule, in a pre-recorded message, Swift said, “Thank you so much for having this me-themed night. I so wish I could be there to see what you and your amazing choreographers and my friend, Mandy Moore, have put together. I wish I could be there, but I’m on tour in Brazil. But I’m sending you guys all my love and best of luck to all the contestants.”

DWTS Season 32 Episode 9 recap and elimination

Each and every dance number did justice to the magic of Swift's Eras Tour. However, considering the competitive aspect of the show, one celebrity must bid farewell. American Pie star Alyson Hannigan and her partner Sasha Farber scored 29 out of 40 for their cha-cha performance to Swift's You Belong With Me.

Judge Carrie Ann Inaba said, “There is a lot of content, more than you’ve ever done. I believe you are here for a reason. You are showing a lot of people what it is to not have a lot of experience. I’m proud of you but you still have work to do.” Following their elimination after the relay rounds, Jowsey said, “I can’t believe we made it this far.”",Entertainment

He will play the lead role of the character Karna from the epic Mahabharata. Now, we have learnt that Nayanthara has been approached for the film.

The source also adds that many other actors from both Bollywood and down South are being considered for the “big scale project.” “Rakeysh will also try to get Priyanka (actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas), but only if Nayanthara gives a nod. The aim is to make something stellar like Atlee’s Jawan, which includes stars from both the industries, so it is going to be a star-studded cast. The film will be shot on a massive scale with a huge budget.”

Karna will be based on Mahabharata’s Karna, the son of the sun god Surya and princess Kunti, and the shooting will start early next year. “The mythological period drama is produced by Excel Entertainment and will go on floors in January 2024.

"From Gal Gadot to Mia Khalifa, Hollywood celebs who were cancelled over remarks about Israel-Hamas conflict","We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Angelina Jolie

Angelina Jolie was criticised for not taking sides and reacting neutrally to the situation. ""Palestinian and Israeli lives—and the lives of all people globally—matter equally,"" she wrote in an Instagram post.

Citing her work as a UN refugee agency ambassador, she said more humanitarian aid should be delivered to the Gaza Strip. ""The few aid trucks that are entering are a fraction of what is needed, and the bombings are causing desperate new humanitarian needs daily,"" she said.

Amy Schumer

Amy Schumer has been outspoken on social media about the conflict. Amy previously wrote on Instagram that she is a ""proud Jewish Woman"" and said she has ""lost so many friends these last few weeks but feel powerful and free knowing I stand for the truth and will fight for it always.""

Another post she shared was an archival footage of Martin Luther King Jr. condemning anti-Semitism and expressing support for Israel.

Later, his daughter Bernice King responded saying, “Certainly, my father was against antisemitism, as am I. He also believed militarism (along with racism and poverty) to be among the interconnected Triple Evils. I am certain he would call for Israel’s bombing of Palestinians to cease, for hostages to be released and for us to work for true peace, which includes justice.""

Amy later said on Instagram that he is ""accepting love and feedback,” and clarified her point. ""What I want is EVERY HOSTAGE BACK. I want safety and freedom from Hamas for Palestinians and Israelis. I want safety for Jewish people and Muslims as well. Everyone. Just like you. I want peace,"" she said.

""You will never see me wishing harm on anyone. Saying I'm Islamophobic or that I like genocide is crazy. So here you go by popular demand. Comments on,"" she added.

Debra Messing

Debra Messing was slammed online after attending the March for Israel rally in Washington, DC, on November 14. Over 290,000 people attended the event at the National Mall.

Debra called the Israel-Hamas conflict ""madness,"" before adding, “This is terrorism. But we will win. We always have."" ""We are strong, resilient and devoted, and we will not lose ourselves,"" the actress said.

""We will worry for our global Jewish family and also hurt for the innocent Palestinians used as human shields by Hamas. We will work to eviscerate Hamas and also pray for a free and flourishing Gaza,” she added.

She continued: ""We will remember and work for the release of the 240 hostages, as well as for the safety of the 2.2 million Gazans also held hostage by Hamas. We will pray for the success of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] for a war Israel did not start, did not want, but a war Israel will win. Because we must. I know you are alone, I know you are afraid, I know you feel abandoned by people you thought were friends. Looking out today I know we are not alone, because we have each other.""

Debra was blasted for not properly acknowledging the Palestinians killed in the conflict.

Gal Gadot

Israeli actor Gal Gadot came under fire for reportedly organising a screening of a graphic footage that was collected from Israel after the October 7 Hamas attack. The audience will comprise famous Hollywood figures in Los Angeles and New York.

Mark Ruffalo

Actor Mark Ruffalo was mocked on social media after sharing a petition to ""End child bloodshed"" in Israel and Gaza on October 19.

Mia Khalifa

Adult film star Mia Khalifa was blasted for calling Hamas terrorists “freedom fighter” on social media. ""Can someone please tell the freedom fighters in Palestine to flip their phones and film horizontal,"" the 30-year-old said on social media.

Noah Schnapp

Stranger Things actor Noah Schnapp came under fire for his statement on the conflict. He told his Instagram followers, in part, “You either stand with Israel or you stand with terrorism.”

Selena Gomez

While Selena Gomez did condemn the violence against innocent civilians, she also said that believes her post will not make a difference despite being one of the most followed people on the Internet. She had thus remained silent on the matter for a long time. Fans reminded her that with millions of followers, she could have definitely made a difference, as opposed to what she suggested.

Susan Sarandon

Susan Sarandon’s attendance at the #March4Palestine rally in Washington D.C divided her followers. Sharing a photo of herself on stage, she wrote, “You don't have to be Palestinian to care about what's happening in Gaza. I stand with Palestine. No one is free until everyone is free.""

Timothée Chalamet

Actor Timothée Chalamet was slammed for appearing in a Saturday Night Live! skit that featured a joke about Hamas.

Melissa Barrera

Actress Melissa Barrera has been dropped from Spyglass Media’s Scream VII because of a series of social media posts on theIsrael-Hamas conflict that she shared. She was fired in the wake of her posts where she expressed support for the Palestinian cause. She also criticised Israeli actions that followed the Hamas attack.

Where is Yuta in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime?,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

In this article, we will explore Why he is not fighting alongside his friends and allies in Shibuya? What is he hiding or waiting for?

During the Jujutsu Kaisen anime events, where is Yuta Okkotsu's?

Yuta, the second-year student enrolled at Tokyo's Jujutsu High, stands out as a formidable sorcerer within the Jujutsu Kaisen series. His potential is acknowledged by Gojo, the preeminent sorcerer of the current era and Yuta's mentor. Gojo foresees the possibility that Yuta may eventually rival or even surpass him in sorcery.

Initially introduced in the Jujutsu Kaisen 0 movie, which predates the events portrayed in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime, this film delves into Yuta's backstory, unveiling the inception of his journey as a sorcerer. Notably, it uncovers Yuta's lineage, tracing his ancestry to Michizane Sugawara, one of the Big Three Vengeful Spirits, establishing a distant connection to the Gojo Clan.

The movie reaches its pinnacle with an intense and flashy confrontation between Yuta and Geto, culminating in Geto's defeat and demise. Subsequently, in a post-credits scene, Yuta is seen relishing local cuisine in Africa, accompanied by Miguel, a foreign sorcerer who had previously clashed with Gojo during Geto's assault on Tokyo, known as the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons.

It is later revealed that Yuta embarked on a journey to Africa to undergo training and study under Miguel in the latter's homeland. Impressively, Yuta and Miguel make an appearance together in the second opening of Jujutsu Kaisen season 2, hinting that they are still in Africa honing their skills.

Yuta's debut is approaching in Jujutsu Kaisen anime

Yuta's entrance into the Jujutsu Kaisen manga unfolds in Chapter 137 during Yuji Itadori's Extermination Arc. Following his return to Tokyo, Yuta is tasked by the Jujutsu society's authorities with the mission to eliminate Itadori.

Bound by a compelling commitment to the higher-ups, Yuta engages in a fierce battle with Itadori, ultimately appearing to fatally wound him by thrusting a blade through his heart. However, the truth behind this intense confrontation gradually surfaces—it was a calculated facade orchestrated to safeguard Itadori from the stringent, traditionalist leaders within the Jujutsu society.

Fans can expect Yuta will make his highly anticipated anime debut towards the end of the Season 2 or at the outset of the Season 3.
