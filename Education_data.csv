More than 50 percent of primary schools across many states have enrolment less than 60: NITI Aayog report,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

“The Project enables a system-wide governance transformation in school education. The objective is to ensure that quality is not diluted even when we operate on a larger scale,” the report quoted B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog.

Also Read:

The report analyses the implementation of Project SATH-E in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha under 9 intervention categories namely school consolidation, remedial learning interventions, assessments, teacher recruitment and rationalisation, teacher capacity building, management information systems and academic monitoring systems, governance and accountability, organisation strengthening and leader schools.

The NITI Aayog report pointed out 6 issues that need to be addressed in order to implement a large-scale transformation in providing quality education. That includes:

Addressing the issue of sub-scale, inadequately resourced schools head-on with strong political support

Solving large-scale teacher vacancies issues

Improving teacher quality and pedagogy

Enforcing accountability towards learning outcomes

Focus on Early Childhood Education (ECE) and contextualised Mother tongue-based Multilingual Education (MLE)

Strengthening the governance structures in education departments

According to the report, India has 5 times the number of schools than China does for the same enrolment of students. It was also mentioned that more than 50% of primary schools across many states in our country have an enrolment of less than 60 students. NITI Aayog puts forward the idea of merging schools as a plan to mitigate the cost of such sub-scale schools.

School merging was executed in the project and the report presented favourable results from the action plan. The report states that third-party studies in SATH-E have also demonstrated that when executed rigorously the benefits of mergers are largely positive and can lead to improved learning outcomes.

Drawing an example from the project being implemented in Madhya Pradesh, the report stated that 35,000 schools were merged into 16,000 same-campus schools with an aim to improve the quality of education. The merged large schools had adequate teachers and resources and 55 percent of the schools now had a principal when compared to 20 percent before the merger. Similarly, in Jharkhand 4380 schools and in Odisha 2000 small-scale and same-campus schools were merged.

In order to address the issue of the unequal distribution and shortage of teachers in the education sector, the report suggested the need to take up teacher rationalisation and structured policies to be implemented. Aligning with the National Education Policy 2020, NITI Aayog also emphasised the need to priortise Early Childhood Education (ECE) to improve the school readiness of the students.

States have been asked to reconsider the decentralisation of powers to principals, district and block officers by the policy think tank. This step according to the report will give them more financial power and autonomy to take decisions in line with local needs.

Study Abroad: How to prepare for GMAT,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

In an exclusive interview, Sandeep Gupta, Founder of Top One Percent, a global EdTech company that provides effective learning solutions to GMAT & GRE aspirants, talks about the basics of GMAT preparation and how to achieve a 99th percentile score.

How to start the GMAT journey? Is downloading GMATPrep practice tests released by makers of the GMAT the first step?

The ideal way to start your GMAT journey is by starting as soon as possible. Even if you're still in college, taking the GMAT can open a plethora of opportunities for you, from job placements to deferred MBA programs. Many test-takers often begin by downloading the GMATPrep practice tests released by the GMAC, the makers of the GMAT.

While these materials provide a basic understanding of the test format, they may not be sufficient for those aiming for scores above 750. In fact, relying solely on these resources can give students a false sense of security. Instead, consider investing in a professional test preparation service.

Are practice tests the best indicator of how far/near one is from the target?

Practice tests are undoubtedly a valuable tool in your GMAT preparation arsenal, but they shouldn't be viewed as the “best” indicator of your likely score on the actual examination.

It is important to note that test-takers frequently report that the scores from official mock tests are somewhat inflated compared to what one might achieve on the actual GMAT. While this can be encouraging, it can also lull test-takers into a false sense of confidence.

One should use practice tests as a means to evaluate and improve their skill set but remember that continuous refinement and focused preparation are key to achieving the target GMAT score.

Should one first find out what GMAT score one actually needs for the university/course of choice? One needs at least 700 for Top 10 schools, 680 for Top 20, and 650 for Top 50 to pass. Is that a good route for a novice to start?

As a rule of thumb, strive to score 30 to 40 points above the median score of your target school. Doing so not only strengthens your chances of gaining admission but can also significantly improve your eligibility for scholarships. Considering the high tuition fees associated with MBA programs, securing a scholarship can provide substantial financial relief.

How should one design the study plan - build a toolkit?

I believe those who attempt to create their own study plans without expert guidance often find themselves lost and directionless. That's why my first piece of advice is to consult with a professional test preparation agency.

However, expert guidance alone won't suffice; self-awareness is equally crucial. You need to know your strengths and weaknesses to target your study efforts effectively. One invaluable tool in this regard is maintaining an error log.

Document every question you get wrong, along with the reason for the mistake. Revisit this error log at least once a week to review your weak areas and revise your strategies.

Online versus offline study plan? Which one is better?

Choosing between online and offline GMAT study plans depends on individual needs. Online plans offer flexibility and a wealth of resources, often adapting to your performance. Offline plans provide structured learning and immediate feedback from instructors. Many find a hybrid approach most effective, leveraging online resources for flexibility and offline methods for structured learning.

How early should one start? On average, it is said, 3 months (10-15 hours a week) is good enough. Is it?

Although a study period of three months, averaging around three hours per day, is commonly recommended for achieving a competitive score, in my opinion, the earlier you start your GMAT journey, the better. Initiating the process while still in college can open myriad opportunities.

What are the typical GMAT prep mistakes and pitfalls?

One of the most frequent issues is inconsistency in preparation. Irregular study patterns can seriously hinder progress. Another pitfall is relying on easier prep materials, which can provide a false sense of confidence.

Not timing oneself during practice and neglecting certain sections, such as Reading Comprehension, can also be detrimental. Some test-takers overestimate their Quantitative skills and neglect focused practice, which can result in a disappointing performance and lower the overall score.

How does one achieve the 99th percentile? Is it as elusive as numbers convey?

About 0.02% of GMAT test-takers, or about 30 people a year, will score a perfect 800 on the test. Achieving a 99th percentile score on the GMAT is challenging but not insurmountable.

In my 27 years of teaching, many of my students have successfully reached this milestone. The recipe for a top score includes studying high-quality material, benefiting from expert guidance, maintaining consistency, keeping an error log, and practicing under timed conditions.

Is there a time-tested mantra to get a good GMAT score?

If there's a time-tested mantra for achieving a strong GMAT score, it's not to neglect the Quantitative and Reading Comprehension sections. Often, people with engineering backgrounds assume they'll naturally excel in Quantitative, only to find themselves falling short.

Also Read: Logical Reasoning series: Tips to crack and ace exams

Similarly, Reading Comprehension is frequently overlooked, despite being a cornerstone for a great GMAT score. A poor performance in this section can easily lower your overall score by 80-90 points.

Why is an SOP important?

Almost all international universities would require an SOP as a part of their admission process. The Statement of Purpose is a crucial document for a candidate that would decide the future of the application at the university. It is a peak into the aspirations and future goals of the applicant which will make an impression among various other deciding factors.

What is the format to write an SOP?

An SOP format usually varies depending on the courses. Over all an SOP must essentially contain an essay written in paragraphs that is organized properly. It is usually a two-page long essay written in around 800-1000 words.

The SOP must highlight your future goals and aspirations and must be able to ascertain your application as the best of the lot.

The paragraphs should contain:

An introduction about yourself

Your academic and professional background (if any)

Why you have chosen the particular course, that will include your future goals and aspirations

Why the university was chosen to embark on your higher education journey

A conclusion that makes you look the right candidate to study at the university.

Things to look out for:

Make sure that your SOP does not look exaggerated and it must be an honest view, needless to say, plagiarised content is a no-no. Try to make the SOP look more engaging, highlighting your core values and strengths. Avoid grammatical mistakes and always proofread before submission.

Take time to think and research what you would like to add to the SOP. Drafting the SOP and taking honest suggestions from a professional is always a good option.

Children's Day 2023: Choose the ideal preschool programme to fit your child's personality and learning style,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Here are four approaches that can nurture social skills and cognitive development of children as suggested by Bhatia:

The Play Way Method

As Fred Donaldson, the creator of an innovative program called Original Play, states, ""Children learn as they play; most importantly, in play, children learn how to learn."" Similarly, the Play Way method positions children at the core of their learning journey, resembling hands-on learning, where kids explore their surroundings and interact with objects to acquire knowledge.

This approach recognises the innate curiosity of children, encouraging them to discover through fun, creativity, and problem-solving. Moreover, it provides a valuable platform for social development as children learn to share, cooperate, and communicate with their friends.

The Waldorf Method

The Waldorf Method stands as one of the widely embraced approaches to learning, with over 1100 schools in more than 75 countries and more than 2000 early childhood programs spanning six continents adopting this method.

Rooted in the childhood development theory formulated by Rudolf Steiner, the Waldorf Method advocates for learning through artistic and creative means, incorporating elements such as storytelling, music, painting, art, and movement.

A key highlight of this method is its emphasis on allowing children to progress at their own pace, mitigating the stress associated with rigid educational benchmarks. Consequently, individuals who undergo the Waldorf Method are poised to develop into independent thinkers and lifelong learners.

The Montessori Method

Italian physician, educator, and innovator Maria Montessori developed this approach with the core idea of ""letting children learn naturally."" The Montessori Method empowers children to take control of their education through hands-on, self-directed learning.

Providing them with tools and resources enables the exploration of their passions and overcoming challenges. This individualized learning method cultivates essential skills, propelling children toward a future of continuous discovery and learning. Moreover, this approach fosters self-discipline, independence, and positive self-esteem in children.

Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in the Finnish Education System

Finland's education system is globally acclaimed as one of the best. Preschool education in Finland is rooted in the belief that childhood is a precious period of life, and they regard children as individuals and whole persons.

The Finnish Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) program is renowned for emphasising play, social interaction, and individualised learning. Moreover, the Finnish system customises learning for each child, focusing on their unique interests and strengths. This approach establishes a positive learning environment that encourages children to explore, discover, and learn at their own pace.

IIT Madras researchers develop app with zero commission fee for inter-city goods transportation,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

The OptRoute mobile application has two user modes, one for the driver and the other for the customer who can place a request for the goods transport. This app connects a driver with the customer by accepting the requests through the app. No commission or onboarding fee for the ride would be taken. Thus, the payment for the ride from the customer goes directly to the driver, with no intermediaries, said IIT Madras in the official press release.

“OptRoute aims to solve the issues in connectivity between drivers and customers in the goods logistics and transport domain. The main issues faced are the unavailability of return load for transporters and vehicle capacity under-utilization. The current market of this domain is highly unorganized making it inefficient. It is also ripe for the deployment of technology-based solutions to reach the goals set by the National Logistics Policy, 2022,” said Prof Narayanaswamy, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras.

There are differences between OptRoute and the existing services, like the zero commission on every transaction made by the driver and the customer, the nominal subscription-based service model and no intermediaries between them as the driver gets paid directly. Additionally, there won't be separate apps- just a single app for both the driver and customer which is available on Android phones and can be downloaded from the Google Play Store.

“We have developed a lightweight mobile application where customers and drivers can get connected. OptRoute does not use any third-party services allowing us to cut down the cost of operation to an absolute minimum and because of the same reason we are able to provide our service with zero percent commission. This design and development has had a significant contribution done by alumni and students of IIT Madras. By the end of this year, we will scale our service to be available in 500+ cities,” said Anuj Fulia, Co-founder, OptRoute Logistics, and an IIT Madras alumnus.

The basic idea was presented during the 2020 Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference held in Cancun, Mexico. Currently the mobile application is available for operational use in multiple cities across the country, including Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Faridabad, Gurugram, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Nagpur, Noida, Panchkula, Pune, Mohali, Surat and Zirakpur, informed IIT Madras.

IIT Roorkee research team develops a one-step separation of milk fat globules based on size,"Due to the ability to selectively separate and focus on the bioactive components of milk, milk microfiltration has gained much attention in the dairy industry. A study conducted by a research team at IIT Roorkee demonstrated the one-step separation of fat globules based on size from bovine milk using a cross-flow microfiltration. Microfiltration unit separating globules from milk based on their size(Handout)

According to a press release by IIT Roorkee, the first author of the research, PhD student Ayushi Kapoor, was granted the International Travel Award by the Science and Engineering Research Board, Department of Science & Technology, Government of India. Her research paper has been selected for oral presentation at the upcoming Annual Conference of the Membrane Society Australasia conference in Perth, Australia in December. The study was recently published in the Separation and Purification Technology journal, and the institute has filed a complete Indian patent for the process.

Further application of milk microfiltration can be seen in food fortification. One such compound is the milk fat globules, a bioactive component that has potential health benefits, which undergo structural and functional damage, membrane phospholipids loss, experience longer processing time, and higher recovery cost due to its current multi-step separation process. The research team developed a one-step process to segregate the smaller milk fat globules from bovine milk with respect to their size, thus preserving their structural and nutritional qualities, mentioned the media release by IIT Roorkee.

Polysulfone Membrane used to separate milk fat globules from cow and buffalo milk.(Handout)

“Our study has developed a one-step process which not only operates efficiently at lower pressure but also successfully preserves the structure of separated fat globules. The current milk fat globule separation techniques involve 4-5 steps which makes it a more time-consuming and costly process. Also, the excess processing steps damage the milk fat globules leading to the reduction in their nutritional properties. Whereas, the process that we have developed directly separates from raw milk, without applying any pre-processing, thus saving time, energy and money, when implemented at the industrial level,” said Ayushi Kapoor, PhD student at IIT Roorkee, who is also the first author of the research.

According to IIT Roorkee, this research will save time, energy and resources. It will also make sure that it is fit to be consumed by people of all age groups. Other purposes of this research could be seen in the utilisation of the isolated fat globules to make food ingredients like infant formula or even serve as raw materials for many high-value products in the food and pharmaceutical industries.",Education

5 common mistakes students preparing for competitive exams should avoid,"We're now on WhatsApp. Click to join.

Many students experience stress and anxiety when they hear the words ‘competitive exams’. Students are under immense pressure to perform well as they believe that these tests will pave the way for their ideal careers. They need focused preparation, suitable study material, and a myriad of other skills to make it to the top ranks in the exam.

But before their preparation gets underway, they must first be aware of the most common mistakes that can derail their exam aspirations. Avoiding these mistakes won’t just make the preparation streamlined but also reduce the pressure, stress, and unnecessary tension weighing on their minds.

Here's a look at some common mistakes that students should steer clear of:

Failing to set a realistic score

Setting a realistic target score has a two-pronged advantage. First, it helps you identify topics that you can skip over. This will leave you with more time and energy to solidify the topics you choose to study.

Second, It will take off the pressure to perform. While it is great to aspire to top the exam, not everyone has the time or space to do so. Instead, look for an ideal range of scores that will help you reach your target college.

For instance, those aspiring for an NMIMS MBA can set a target score of 250 to clear the cutoffs instead of chasing the elusive 290+. Those looking to get into great UG courses abroad can aim for a 1400+ score on their SATs. Realistic targets based on an innate understanding of your own capabilities, time, and resources are a great way to start your prep on a positive note.

Neglecting Mock Tests

A wonderful method to assess your subject-matter understanding is through mock tests. Most high scorers take as many mock tests as possible to gain experience with actual exams.

Taking mock tests helps you not only become familiarised with the format of the exam but also evaluate your performance under stress. It will highlight your areas of weakness so that you can strengthen them.

Taking mock tests can assist you in becoming more adept at managing your time. It helps you to craft your test-taking strategy, especially when it is a speed test. As the exam date approaches, shift your focus to taking as many mocks as possible.

Leaving Your Errors Unreviewed

Make sure you carefully evaluate your performance after taking a mock test to identify your weak points. If you keep making the same mistakes, there is no benefit in practicing for mock exams. A targeted approach to address areas where you lack confidence is a wise way to boost your performance.

Focus on strengthening these areas through practice. To keep your learning curve expanding, track your development over time and evaluate your performance on succeeding mock tests.

Poor Time Management

Time management abilities are not only necessary during the planning phase but also when you are seated in the exam room writing your paper. Once you become accustomed to the exam format, schedule your mock tests.

Compare the amount of time you spend on each question to the recommended amount of time for each section. This will assist you in effectively managing your time, which is a productive strategy that will undoubtedly boost your sense of confidence.

Refusing to Revise

Most students begin studying for exams at the last moment, leaving little time for revision and mock tests. It's critical to comprehend the importance of revision.

You review concepts when you revise, which improves your ability to remember them during crucial moments. Revision strengthens your memory's ability to retain essential information, which will help you work even harder to reach your objectives.

One way to review and get ready for an exam is through mock tests. To ensure that you have enough time to review before taking the exams, make sure to arrange your schedule backwards.

Strategic Preparation for Competitive Exams!

It takes more than just effort to succeed in competitive exams. It is essential to steer clear of issues, including having unrealistic expectations for scores, skipping mock tests, not reviewing mistakes, managing your time poorly, and not revising your work.

One can significantly increase their chances of cracking these demanding exams by creating a well-organised study strategy incorporating these components. It’s advised to read about the strategies used by toppers and expert mentors so that you can adopt the best practices for yourself and avoid wasting too much time reinventing the wheel.
